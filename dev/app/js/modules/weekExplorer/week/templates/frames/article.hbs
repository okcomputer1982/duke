<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
<p>
The Multimedia College Preparation Program is entitled “A STUDENT’S JOURNEY: TO COLLEGE AND BEYOND” and is an interactive learning environment that combines course materials, interactive tools and narrative, instructional videos, comics, educational games, activities, journals, quizzes and facilitates discussions through asynchronous and synchronous instructional support.
 </p>


<p>
A STUDENT’S JOURNEY will act as an interactive guide to facilitate an existing college admissions counseling program, or can stand-alone if you do not have access to a college admissions counselor.  You will fully engage with the learning environment three hours a week for 15 weeks each semester for a total of 90 academic hours.</p>

<p>
<em>Semester One:</em> The first semester of A STUDENT’S JOURNEY (mid-October through mid-January) will focus on helping you understand the US educational system, learning about yourself, and finding the college or university that is the best fit for you.  You will interactively navigate through the U.S. college admissions process and learn how to successfully utilize sources at your disposal such as The College Board and CFNC (College Foundation of North Carolina).
</p>
 
<p>
<em>Semester Two:</em> Many international students only worry about getting into a good college and spend little time preparing for the transition to and success in college once they arrive. Unfortunately, this can result in a student dropping out due to a difficult transition into the U.S. culture and lack of preparation for the first year of college. Therefore, the second semester of A STUDENT’S JOURNEY (mid-February through mid-May) will provide strategies for you to succeed in your first year of college and provide valuable insight regarding your successful cultural integration into the U.S.
</p>

<h4>WEEKLY LEARNING OBJECTIVES:</h4>
<p>
Each week you will be given a series of learning objectives which will be accomplished through a variety of activities.  
</p>

<h4>ASSESSMENT:</h4>
<p>A STUDENT’S JOURNEY is designed to help you gain knowledge and comprehension as well as increase your competency in various attributes which we believe you will need to have in order to succeed in the applying to and attending a U.S. college.  These attributes include Intercultural Competence, Exploration, Reflection, Introspection, Thoroughness, Accuracy, Application, and Analysis.  Using a variety of assessment techniques such as quizzes, journals, discussion forums, and your successful completion of tasks, we will determine the level to which you are increasing these important characteristics or “attributes” and completing tasks.  A STUDENT’S JOURNEY will help you check your progress along the way as you improve in these areas and you will also have the opportunity to earn “badges” along the way upon completing tasks.  Students who successfully complete the program will receive a CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION.</p>

<h4>Picking the Right School</h4>
 
<p>What is the point of going to a very expensive Ivy League school to get your undergraduate degree when you know that you are going to get your master's degree when you're done? I would like to go to Dartmouth, but I have a full scholarship to the University of Florida, so maybe I should go there and go to Dartmouth for my MBA. What is your opinion?
Ivy League schools offer students great education and prestige. Many students find these schools attractive because they are selective, and because a degree from such a school is impressive on a job application. Yet there are great schools all over the country that offer a wonderful education and are easier to get into. And, as you know, public schools such as the University of Florida are more affordable. 
The best way to decide what school is best for you is to consider all the angles. Ask yourself: "What schools offer strong programs in my major? How important is cost and will this scholarship make life easier for me in the future? Do I want to be close to home or further away on my own? What kind of college life is there?"</p>

<p>Do you prefer a large or small school? Would you be more comfortable in a traditional campus not close to a major city, or do you prefer to be in a large city? Are you looking for a certain student mix in terms of gender, religion, race, etc.? All of these questions play a major role in the college decision. You are right—if you choose to attend the University of Florida, you can always pursue a master's degree at Dartmouth or at another big-name school. But try not to think too far ahead. Base your decision on what each school can do for you right now as you pursue your bachelor’s degree.</p>

<p>I'm interested in a lot of different colleges and don't know which one I want to choose. Please help.</p>

<p>The best way to narrow down which colleges are best for you is to first ask yourself several general questions about college:</p>

<ul>
	<li>-What am I interested in pursuing as a major?</li>
	<li>-What schools offer strong programs in my major?</li>
	<li>-How important is cost, and will scholarships be available at this school?</li>
	<li>-Do I want to live at home or on campus?</li>
	<li>-Do I want to be close to home or further away on my own?</li>
	<li>-Will I be more comfortable at a large university or a small private college?</li>
	<li>-Are my grades and test scores sufficient for acceptance?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve answered each of these questions, make a list of the colleges you are considering and decide which ones best fit the criteria set by your answers.</p>

<p>The next step is to get specific information from each school left on the list. You may contact the schools directly or visit their websites to request catalogs, viewbooks, brochures, and anything else you think might aid the decision-making process.</p>

<p>Finally, once you’ve narrowed the list down again, schedule campus visits to the schools you are still interested in. You can schedule a tour, see a dorm room, and perhaps even sit on a class. Many students base their final decision on a really good a campus visit. Then, once you’ve chosen the perfect school, begin the admissions process.
Follow this process and you should have no trouble (or at least less trouble!) choosing the right school for you.</p>

<p>I am a junior. I eventually want to attend Harvard Medical School, and a friend of the family (a physician) said I should definitely try to get into Harvard for undergraduate work because those students have a better chance of being accepted into the med school. Is that true (not only for Harvard but for most med schools)? My high school counselor says if my grades, activities and MCAT scores are great in college, it won't matter where I get my undergrad degree.</p>

<p>To a certain degree, both your counselor and your family friend are correct. Schools like Harvard do always select a few of their own schools for their graduate programs, but to be one of the students their medical school takes, you’ll need to be one of the top students in your college class.</p>

<p>Your counselor is correct, because if you work hard and excel at any school, medical schools will want you in their incoming class. So, if you want to be a doctor, don’t worry too much about whether you get into Harvard for undergraduate work. There are many fine schools...and in determining the right place for you, you should take into account not only academic reputation, but also factors such as financial aid availability, size, location, student body mix, social life and clubs and activities. Ultimately, the school where you are the happiest is the one that will give you the most satisfying college experience...and will also be the one where you’re most likely to excel well enough to get into medical school.</p>

<p>Ultimately, both are correct, because both are saying that medical schools like Harvard want the best students. However, don’t get too hung up on going just to Harvard Medical School, as there are many other excellent medical schools and you’ll become a doctor if you go through any of them. So apply to a wide range to colleges, Harvard included, and work really hard in college. Then, whether you go to Harvard or somewhere else, you should be in a good position to get into a great medical school. Good luck!</p>

<p>My son is awaiting  decisions on colleges he has applied to. In addition, he has wanted to go on to medical school for years now. So far he has heard early from two schools: University of Connecticut, where he has received a very nice scholarship, and Brandeis, but with no scholarship. Assuming we may see a mix of acceptances, with and without scholarship, from other private and public schools of different rankings, is it worth the higher cost for the higher-ranked schools vs. accepting (happily on our part) the scholarship at the other schools? It has been my contention that one is better off doing well in whatever school you attend, including on the MCAT, and that the pressure may be less in some of the "less competitive" schools (the big fish, small pond theory), especially when we are talking about all respectable schools. Do you agree, or am I letting the dollars sway my thinking? Thanks very much for your thoughts!</p>

<p>First, congratulations on your son’s acceptances. You should be very proud.</p>

<p>Personal finances and your ability and willingness to pay more for a school are subjective and something I can’t fairly comment on. That said, while it probably isn’t worth going to the higher ranked school just to get your son into medical school (since that decision won’t be based necessarily on tougher competition), you should consider factors other than rankings when helping your son choose a school: among these: the school’s strength in your son’s intended major, the strength of the school’s premed program (if they have one, and if not, the quality of their science offerings), financial aid/scholarships (I know your son has gotten a scholarship from UConn, but he may get similar offers from other schools as well), student life (such as clubs, activities, athletics, etc.), the student mix (such as male/female ratio, religious and political leanings and socioeconomics of the student body), location, and size.</p>

<p>Your son may also want to consider the breadth and quality of other majors offered at the school just in case he decides not to go to medical school or if he decides to major in something considered “nontraditional” for premed students.</p>

<p>So what you need to figure out is what, if anything, you’re willing and able to pay for your son’s education and finding a school within these financial means where your son is going to be happy. After all, if he’s happy, he’s more likely to do well in school. Good luck!</p>

<p>I have recently been admitted to Mississippi State University and to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Right now I would like to study meteorology. Mississippi State has a great meteorology program, and it's the closest meteorology school to my home. I have been on campus, and I really love the atmosphere there. However, all of my best friends that I've known my entire life are going to Chattanooga. I can't imagine life without them, and I know we would have an amazing college experience together. I figure if I go to UT-Chatt, then I could study something in the medical field, since I am also interested in this. Both scholarship amounts I would receive from each school are about the same. </p>

<p>So I really don't know which to choose. Can you help me?</p>

<p>Thanks for this question. I have been thinking about it for a little while, and I have decided that instead of giving you an answer, I'm going to ask you two questions in return.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>1) If you decide to go to Chattanooga with your friends, it's possible that your group will start to drift apart a little (after all, the college atmosphere is different, and young adults tend to change the most in college). Will you still feel as though you will have a good college experience there, or will you feel resentful for going there and wish you had gone to Mississippi State? </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>2) How much do you care about studying meteorology? Do you believe it is something you are completely passionate about, or do you feel about the same about it as you might a different program of study?</p>
	</li>
</ul>


<p>I encourage you to think about these questions, think about what your expectations are at present for college, think about what you value most, and talk to your friends and adult mentors about this dilemma. I wish you wisdom in your decision-making.</p>

<p>My son is a senior far away from his family at boarding school. Working in an architectural office this summer made him interested in architecture and industrial design. The problem is that all his art classes from middle school on had to do with music, and he has no works for his portfolio. He signed up for a drawing class now and his art teacher seems excited by his work. Will he be effected with a sort of "thin" portfolio? Secondly, he and his adviser put some schools on his list like Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. We decided that because of his limited preparation in arts, but also as a practical advantage in the job world, he should go for schools with a technical approach and not completely arty. Would Virginia Tech be recommended? What sites are available that give you insights to colleges (other than the facts on schools own websites)? Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>If you want more recommendations, I'd suggest you seek information from objective resources like architectural firms themselves. If you know of architects, ask them from which schools their firms frequently pull graduates. Also check outArchitect Magazine online. It offers a wide variety of resources to aspiring architects, including its ranking of best architecture schools.</p>

<p>Also check with your son to see what aspects of architecture he is specifically loving. Is it the artistic aspect of creating something original in 3-dimensional form? Or is he more drawn to the technical and mathematical aspects of architecture? It doesn't hurt to keep the options open; an art school isn't out of the question quite yet just because of his "limited preparation" as you mentioned.</p>

<p>In addition, find out what specific kind of architecture your son likes. There are so many branches of architecture (for example, you mentioned Virginia Tech--it's actually ranked number 1 currently in landscape architecture). Does your son like modern architecture? restoration architecture of old buildings? garden and outdoor parks architecture? Do a little research. Google is going to be your best friend on this journey.</p>

<p>Also, I wouldn't worry about your son's "thin" portfolio just yet. But make sure to gather what you've got. Be absolutely sure to mention his work in an architectural office when he starts applying to schools.</p>

<p>And I would bet he still has time to put together some quality pieces, artistic or otherwise. He should talk to the industrial tech and art teachers at his schools to see whether he could work on some specialized architectural design pieces on an independent basis. Or he could ask the firm he worked at to help in more depth with some of their projects on an apprentice sort of basis. Chances are, if he really does want to do this, he'll love putting together that kind of work for his portfolio anyway.</p>

<p>Enrollment at American colleges is sliding, but competition for spots at top universities is more cutthroat and anxiety-inducing than ever. In the just-completed admissions season, Stanford University accepted only 5 percent of applicants, a new low among the most prestigious schools, with the odds nearly as bad at its elite rivals.</p>

<p>Deluged by more applications than ever, the most selective colleges are, inevitably, rejecting a vast majority, including legions of students they once would have accepted. Admissions directors at these institutions say that most of the students they turn down are such strong candidates that many are indistinguishable from those who get in.</p>

<p>Isaac Madrid applied to 11 colleges, a scattershot approach that he said is fairly typical at his private high school, Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, Calif. Students there are all too aware of the long odds against getting into any particular elite university. “It was a crazy amount of work and stress doing all those essays by the deadline and keeping up my schoolwork, and waiting on the responses, and we had more than $800 in application fees,” he said.</p>

<p>Isaac Madrid, who attends a private high school in San Jose, Calif., applied to 11 colleges and was accepted at Yale. Credit Thor Swift for The New York Times Mr. Madrid, 18, got a taste of how random the results can seem. He was among the 95 percent turned away by Stanford, but he got into Yale, which he plans to attend, and he admitted having no real insight into the reasons for either decision.</p>

<p>Bruce Poch, a former admissions dean at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., said he saw “the opposite of a virtuous cycle at work” in admissions. “Kids see that the admit rates are brutal and dropping, and it looks more like a crapshoot,” he said. “So they send more apps, which forces the colleges to lower their admit rates, which spurs the kids next year to send even more apps.”</p>

<p>For most of the past six decades, overall enrollment boomed, while the number of seats at elite colleges and universities grew much more slowly, making them steadily more selective. Enrollment peaked in 2011, and it has dropped a bit each year since then, prompting speculation that entry to competitive colleges would become marginally easier. Instead, counselors and admissions officers say, the pool of high-achieving applicants continues to grow, fed partly by a rising number from overseas.</p>

<p>At the same time, students send more applications than they once did, abetted by the electronic forms that have become nearly universal and uniform applications that can make adding one more college to the list just a matter of a click. Seven years ago, 315 colleges and universities accepted the most widely used form, the Common Application; this year, 517 did.</p>

<p>Students applying to seven or more colleges made up just 9 percent of the applicant pool in 1990, but accounted for 29 percent in 2011, according to surveys by the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and counselors and admissions officers say they think the figure has gone higher still. While people have lavished attention on a Long Island teenager who was accepted by all eight Ivy League colleges, admissions professionals say it is remarkable that anyone would apply to all eight.</p>

<p>Stanford received 42,167 applications for the class of 2018 and sent 2,138 acceptance notices, for a first-year class that, ultimately, will number about 1,700.</p>

<p>The University of California, Los Angeles, the national leader in applications, had more than 86,000 requests — twice as many as in 2005 — for space in a first-year class of about 6,000, and it also received 19,000 applications to transfer from other colleges and universities. This year, for the first time, the admission rate for first-year applicants at U.C.L.A. and the University of California, Berkeley, could drop below 20 percent.</p>

<p>Students at Yale University last spring. A generation ago, it was rare for even highly competitive colleges to offer places to fewer than 20 percent of their applicants. Credit Christopher Capozziello for The New York Times “For most kids, this really used to be a regional process, but they have access to so much information online now, so every school seems local,” said Richard H. Shaw, the dean of undergraduate admission at Stanford. Admissions directors at several top Eastern colleges agreed, saying that they now received more applications from California than any other state, which would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p>

<p>Some of them also pointed to colleges’ increasingly aggressive outreach to prospective students, with mailings, emails and advertising — some of it well intentioned, and some of it more cynical.</p>

<p>“One of the ways that colleges are measured is by the number of applicants and their admit rate, and some colleges do things simply to increase their applicant pool and manipulate those numbers,” said Christoph Guttentag, the dean of undergraduate admission at Duke.</p>

<p>A generation ago, it was rare for even highly competitive colleges to offer places to fewer than 20 percent of their applicants. In 2003, Harvard and Princeton drew exclamations of dismay (from prospective applicants), envy (from other colleges) and satisfaction (from those they accepted) when they became the first top universities to have their admission rates dip below 10 percent. Since then, at least a dozen have gone below that threshold.
This was the second year in a row that Stanford had the worst odds of admission among top colleges, a title that in previous years was usually claimed by Harvard. This year, by the April 1 deadline for most colleges to send admission notices, Harvard and Yale had accepted about 6 percent of applicants, Columbia and Princeton about 7 percent, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago about 8 percent. (Some rates will increase by a few tenths of a percentage point as colleges accept small numbers of applicants from waiting lists.)</p>

<p>Several universities, including Stanford, Duke, Northwestern, Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania, had admission rates this year that were less than half of those from a decade ago. The University of Chicago’s rate plummeted to a little over 8 percent, from more than 40 percent.</p>

<p>The most competitive small colleges draw comparably accomplished applicants, but far fewer of them relative to their size, so their admission rates are higher. Even so, the acceptance rates at Pomona, Amherst, Harvey Mudd, Bowdoin, Claremont McKenna, Swarthmore, Middlebury, Williams and others were between 10 and 20 percent this year.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw, the Stanford dean, said he could not predict where the rates would bottom out — in fact, he never expected them to go as low as they have.</p>

<p>“Honestly,” he said, “I’m sort of in shock.”</p>

<p>A version of this article appears in print on April 9, 2014, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Best, Brightest and Rejected: Elite Colleges Turn Away Up to 95%.</p>

<p>Citation: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/us/led-by-stanfords-5-top-colleges-acceptance-rates-hit-new-lows.html?_r=0">The New York Times</a></p>

<div class="articleItem textblock" data-id="3">
<p>Ashley Koski, Durham, NC, ranked third in the senior class at Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Va., has wanted to attend Duke University since she was 12.Prospective applicants visited Duke, which has a waiting list of more than 3,000 this year.</p>

<p>Late last month, she learned that Duke had neither accepted nor rejected her. It had offered her a spot on the waiting list — along with 3,382 other applicants. That is almost twice the size of the incoming freshman class.</p>

<p>“I kind of just went quiet the rest of the day,” Ms. Koski said. “I’d rather have a yes or no. I can’t make plans and be excited like the rest of my friends.”</p>

<p>Duke, which had a record 27,000 freshman applicants, has placed 856 more on its waiting list than a year ago. The reasons include the uncertain economy, which makes it hard for Duke to estimate how many of the 4,000 it has accepted will say yes.</p>

<p>If Duke’s best guess holds, no more than 60 will be admitted through the narrow gate of what is essentially a giant holding pen.</p>

<p>Other schools are also hedging their bets this spring. Most Ivy League colleges had sharp jumps in applications, as did similarly selective colleges like the University of Chicago, Northwestern, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Many students hedged bets of their own, and submitted more applications — in some instances 15 or more.</p>

<p>The admission process is a complicated dance of supply and demand for colleges. And this spring, many institutions have accepted fewer applicants, and placed more on waiting lists, until it becomes clear over the next few weeks how many spots remain.</p>

<p>M.I.T., which had a 6 percent increase in applicants, increased its waiting list by more than half, to 722. Last year, it accepted fewer than 80 from that list. Yale, which had a slight dip in applications this year yet still admitted fewer than 8 percent of applicants, placed nearly 1,000 others on its waiting list, an increase of more than 150. Dartmouth increased its list by about 80, to 1,740.</p>

<p>No selective college, though — at least none that makes its figures public — has placed as many applicants in a holding pattern this spring as Duke, which has seen applications surge by 30 percent over the last two years. And those applications were filed long before its men’s basketball team won this year’s national collegiate championship, a victory that could prompt more students to say yes to Duke’s offer of admission, and thus leave fewer slots for those in waiting.</p>

<p>In an interview on a recent morning on Duke’s Gothic-style campus, which was mostly built in the 1930’s but looks centuries older, Christoph Guttentag, the dean of undergraduate admissions, likened his task to that of a sculptor finishing a work of art — and the waiting list to his last palette of materials.</p>

<p>“I have no idea what I’m going to need to finish sculpting the class,” he said, his voice echoing off walls of native knotty pine. “From an institutional perspective, it’s important that I have some flexibility.” 
Like its competitors, Duke does not rank students on its waiting list. Instead, decisions about who will rise to the top are often a function of what the admissions office perceives as deficiencies in the next freshman class. There might be, for example, a surplus of aspiring engineers and not enough potential English majors, or too few students from Florida. Or there might be an unexpected shortage of oboe players. 
While Mr. Guttentag encourages students on the waiting list to send him a one-page letter — or a video of 60 seconds or less — letting him know how strongly they wish to attend, and why, they can do little to improve their chances.</p>

<p>“The student can’t know, ‘Gee, did all the violinists decide to turn us down?’ ” he said. “They can’t affect this very much at this point.”</p>

<p>Since waiting list offers went out in late March, Mr. Guttentag and his colleagues have been deliberating whether to end the suspense for at least several hundred who are on it — those who probably have little hope of coming off.</p>

<p>Another reason the list is so long this year, he said, is that he and his colleagues were so overwhelmed by the volume of applicants that they ran out of time.</p>

<div class="articleItem textblock" data-id="4">
<p>Of all college statistics, the admission rate might be the most misleading. Which is saying something because there are other strong candidates for that title. Graduation rates, for instance.
The admission rate looks straightforward enough: Admission offers divided by applications. But what is an offer, and what is an application?</p>

<p>At the end of the recruiting cycle, a waiting list might be wholly converted to admission offers. Those don’t get included in the calculations in the initial flurry of news releases as colleges issue decisions.</p>

<p>Various colleges define applications in various ways. Some are quite strict about only counting apps that have all required elements in a file — essays, test scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, etc. Others essentially count anyone who starts the process and pays a fee.
Volume of applications can rise or fall based on whether a college asks for a supplemental essay, whether it just joined the Common Application or some other collective online portal, or whether the Common App itself changes its format.</p>

<p>It also matters a great deal how many applicants are accepted through binding early decision programs that require students to enroll if given an offer. A college might load up on ED admits and then deny admission to a huge number of regular-cycle applicants.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Admission rates are volatile from year to year, and comparing rates from one college to another is a precarious business.
Still, these rates are closely watched and impossible to ignore. Every student wants to know: What are my chances? Admission rates don’t really convey what the chances are for an individual applicant, but they usually reflect something about a college’s position in the hotly competitive market. So here is a sampling of rates for colleges and universities for students who applied to enter as freshmen in the fall for the Class of 2018. The figures combine all early and regular admission offers.</p>

<p>We’re expanding on a list we put together last week for the Ivy League. The first portion of this list is drawn from the top 20 schools on each of two sets of the U.S. News & World Report rankings, for liberal arts colleges and national universities. The second portion is comprised of selected schools in Maryland, Washington and the District of Columbia (some of which are also in the top 20). We’ll update this file as we get more information.</p>

<p>One more caveat: All of this is preliminary. There will be many changes before and after the May 1 deadline for admitted students to decide which offer to accept.</p>

<h4>Admissions Statistics</h4>

<p>The admissions process, while time-consuming and complex, is also fun and fascinating. Below, we've included some important facts and figures that will help you understand the trends in admission over the past 5-10 years.</p>

<h4>College Acceptance Rates</h4>
<p>In 2014, college acceptance rates dropped as low as 5.07% for the first time ever. Some of the most selective schools were Harvard University (5.9%) in Cambridge, MA, Stanford University (5.07%) in Palo Alto, CA, Yale University (6.26%) in New Haven, CT, and Columbia University (6.94%) in New York, NY.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Fun Facts for Applicants</h4>
<p>You may think you have heard or read all there is to know about the applications, numbers, and statistics, but there are many schools that deviate from the norm. At IvyWise, we keep our fingers on the pulse of education; here are some colleges and universities that are setting themselves apart from other institutions.</p>

<p>Some schools are more selective than the ones listed above. For example, the Curtis Institute of Music admitted just 2.94% of graduates for the class of 2015. That's even lower than Harvard University, which admitted 5.9% of applicants for the class of 2016. </p>

<p>Many selective colleges encourage art, music, and dance submissions as part of their undergraduate application process. In 2009, Tufts University in Medford, MA encouraged students to submit a one-minute YouTube video. Since then, schools like Chapman University and Michigan State University have followed suit.</p>

<p>For the Fall 2008 entering class, the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD had the highest yield rate (percentage of students who attended compared to the number accepted) of any liberal arts college. Second place went to the United States Military Academy in West Point, NY.</p>

<p>Georgetown University in Washington, DC, is one of the few schools to require an interview for undergraduate admissions. </p>

<p>The smallest college in the country is Alaska Bible College, with 38 students. They admit 100% of their applicants. </p>

<p>Antioch College in Ohio is the only liberal arts college to require an off-campus, co-operative work program of all of its students. 
Of the class of 2013 at Hampshire College, in Amherst, MA, one in seven students founded at least one new organization during their high school careers.</p>

<p>In 2012, the University of California, Berkeley was the most selective public university in the U.S., admitting 21.13% of applicants. Previously, the title was held by University of California, Los Angeles, which in 2012 admitted 21.27%.</p>

<p>The average student uses 400 sheets of paper during the college application process. Currently, over 200 colleges and universities have gone paperless. IvyWise went paperless in the summer of 2010 (spurred by a suggestion from IvyWise interns, one of whom was a former IvyWise student).</p>

<p>In 2014, it was reported that public high school college counselors spend 23% of their time on college advising. According to NACAC, in 2010-11, the national public school student-to-counselor ratio was 473:1.
Lebanon Valley College in Pennsylvania offers the Vickroy Scholarship, which is half-off tuition, to all prospective students who graduate in the top 10% of their high school class. </p>

<p>Every year, the University of Chicago challenges applicants to create a unique admissions essay question. The best questions are featured on the following year's application. </p>

<p>High school students may not take the SATand SAT Subject Tests on the same day. If they were allowed to, students would be testing for approximately seven hours.</p>

<p>At over $61,236 per year (including cost of living), Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, NY is the most expensive school in the U.S. 
At the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, 3,000 applicants to the class of 2014 were waitlisted. The school admitted 3,847 applicants. Even if every admitted student chose another school, Penn still had enough waitlisted students to fill its freshman class (2,501 students in 2009).</p>

<p>In 2012, MIT in Boston, MA, waitlisted 849 students compared to 455 in 2009, an 86% increase. </p>

<p>All 4-year colleges and universities in the United States accept the ACT.</p>

<p>With more than 50 colleges and universities within 50 square miles, Boston is the metropolitan area with the most accredited higher education institutions.</p>

<p>In 2013, business was the most popular undergraduate major for both men and women.</p>

<p>Though the number of women applying to college exceeds the number of men by a ratio of 60:40, the United States Air Force Academy (79% male), the California Maritime Academy (80% male), and the Berklee College of Music (71% male) all boast large male student populations.</p>

<p>Involvement in extracurricular activities allows students opportunities to develop skills in areas of their individual talents or interests. It also provides a new avenue to meet classmates with similar interests. Participation in extracurricular activities increases self-esteem, promotes responsibility, assists students with time management skills, builds socialization skills and is favorable to college entrance committees. Many students participate in several different extracurricular activities throughout the school year.</p>

<p>Extracurricular activities that focus on academic areas include the school newspaper, quiz team, science club, school government, debate team or journalism club. Each of these activities promotes academic excellence and provides students with an opportunity to expand their content knowledge outside the classroom. While building leadership skills, students will also learn the benefits of technical writing, keeping and meeting deadlines and public speaking. Students will also have opportunities to broaden their content knowledge about unfamiliar subjects by conducting research in preparation for debates or academic competitions.</p>

<p>Athletic Focused Activities</p>

<p>Extracurricular activities that focus on athletics include sports such as basketball, volleyball, baseball, track, softball, cheerleading, football and soccer. Some schools offer even more sports teams to join, and some students play a different sport each season. Being part of an athletic team allows students to learn important life skills such as cooperation, sportsmanship, respect, responsibility, leadership and dedication. Students learn the importance of working together, and many stereotypes and barriers are broken on the field. Participation in sports often results in lifelong friendships.</p>

<p>Interest Focused Activities</p>
<p>Extracurricular activities that focus on individual interests include the technology club, chess club, yearbook staff, photography club, dance club, 4-H club, drama club, band and chorus. Participation in these activities allows students to showcase their skills in areas of their interests while forming new friendships with peers who are like-minded. Some possible school activities might include performing help-desk duties for educators in the building, photographing school events, participating in plays and skits, playing a variety of musical instruments, performing in concerts and running school news programs.</p>

			<p>When we think about borders, we tend to think of administrative boundaries. Those demarcating lines, often grown out of rivers and mountain ranges or diplomatic quirks, govern our daily lives, and that’s doubly so if we live near a neighboring country or state.</p>

			<p>We know that these boundaries are on some level unnatural. Driving around Kansas City, where I live, makes this abundantly clear. Gas price differences aside, it can be difficult to tell which state you’re in, Missouri or Kansas, and the small street of State Line Road does nothing to make it clearer.</p>

			<p>But are there more organic borders, brought to life by our own actions and activities? I recently set out, along with a team from MIT and AT&T, to see if I could find an answer. Previously, members of our group had collaborated to use mobile phone call and text message records to determine how tightly connected different counties are to each other. But communication is far from the only way in which we are connected or separated. We can be connected based on where we move, how we speak, and even what sports teams we root for.</p>

			<p>So our research team, consisting of DeDe Paul of AT&T, Vincent Blondel of Belgium’s Université catholique de Louvain, IBM's Dominik Dahlem*, and myself, set out to understand how a variety of cultural and social properties create borders, and whether or not these borders actually overlap. Are there in fact natural boundaries to the borders that we create as social creatures?</p>

			<p>Let’s first examine the different borders we can define. We first have communication, from cell phone data. The map above, based on aggregated phone calls between counties, makes use of an algorithm we developed that detects communities within networks. The result is a visualization of highly connected counties, grouped together by color. These clusters of connected places sometimes coincide with political boundaries, but in many other cases do not.</p>

			<p>Historically, communication and mobility were closely tied together; you could only interact directly with people in person. But with the advent of the telephone and the Internet, these two parts of human behavior have become disentangled. So, does mobility affect the borders we find?</p>

			<p>Using data from IRS migration records—where people relocate to—we constructed a similar map, but this time based on mobility. In this case, we connected and grouped counties based on where people moved, rather than to whom they spoke. Instead of showing the different groupings, we have this time highlighted the borders between these regions.</p>

			<p>What we found is that, for the most part, there is a great deal of overlap between communication and mobility. This is especially clear in the South, where the border between Mississippi and Arkansas is present for all of the data. In other words, people in Mississippi (or Arkansas) primarily interact with others in their own state, and even tend to move only within the state. Despite all the technology at our disposal, in many ways we are still products of place.</p>

			<p>One of the clearest regional differences in the U.S. can found by tracking the words people use to refer to soft drinks, which is in fact the map you saw at the top of this story. Pop or soda, or even Coke, these small linguistic differences are not as small as we might think. While “soda” commands the Northeast and West Coast (green) and “pop” is in between (black), “Coke” reigns in the south (turquoise). These small distinctions can often act as touchstones for larger cultural differences.</p>

			<p>While we as humans are incredibly complicated organisms, there are a few simple rules to how we behave. We sort ourselves based on cultural similarities, and these in turn are related to how we choose to move from place to place, and even with whom we communicate. A lot of these boundaries are porous and messy, allowing for a rich diversity of cultural flow. But knowing how we interact as part of a complex society, instead of only looking at political borders, can explain a lot more than we might have imagined.</p>

	<h4>U.S. Higher Education Glossary</h4>

	<strong>International students: Your search for the best U.S. university for you starts here.</strong>
	<p>What's the difference between a college and a university? Who are undergraduate students versus graduate students? What's the FAFSA? Studying in the United States can be confusing if you don't fully understand the words used in U.S. higher education. With that in mind, U.S. News has compiled a glossary of important terms specifically for international students and parents. While this list is not exhaustive, it offers a key starting point as you explore the best U.S. universities for you.</p>

	<p><strong>Academic adviser: </strong> A member of a school's faculty who provides advice and guidance to students on academic matters, such as course selections.</p>

	<p><strong>Academic year: </strong> Annual period during which a student attends and receives formal instruction at a college or university, typically from August or September to May or June. The academic year may be divided into semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other calendars.</p>

	<p><strong>Accredited: </strong> Official recognition that a college or university meets the standards of a regional or national association. Although international students are not required to attend an accredited college or university in the United States, employers, other schools, and governments worldwide often only recognize degrees from accredited schools.</p>

	<p><strong>ACT (American College Test): </strong> A standardized college entrance exam administered by the American College Testing Program. Four separate, multiple-choice tests measure knowledge of English, math, reading, and science, and one optional writing test measures essay planning and writing skills. Most students take the ACT during their junior or senior year of high school, and most colleges and universities accept scores from either the ACT or SAT. Some schools may recommend, but not require, international students to take the ACT or SAT. (See the U.S. News college test prep guide for more information.)</p>

	<p><strong>Affidavit of Support: </strong> An official document proving adequate funding from an individual or organization to cover an international student's educational and living expenses while enrolled at a U.S. college or university.</p>

	<p><strong>AP (Advanced Placement program): </strong> A program offered by the College Board, a U.S.-based nonprofit educational organization, that allows students to take college-level courses while in high school. Students can then take standardized AP exams; those with qualifying scores can earn credit at certain colleges and universities.</p>

	<p><strong>Assistantship:</strong> A financial aid award granted to a graduate student to help pay for tuition that is offered in return for certain services, such as serving as a teaching assistant or research assistant.</p>

	<p><strong>Associate's:</strong> An undergraduate degree awarded by a college or university upon successful completion of a program of study, usually requiring two years of full-time study. An associate's is typically awarded by community colleges; it may be a career or technical degree, or it may be a transfer degree, allowing students to transfer those credits to a four-year bachelor's degree-granting school.</p>

	<p><strong>Audit: </strong> To take a class to gain knowledge about a subject, but without receiving credit toward a degree.</p>

	<p><strong>Bachelor's: </strong> An undergraduate degree awarded by a college or university upon successful completion of a program of study, typically requiring at least four years (or the equivalent) of full-time study. Common degree types include bachelor of arts (B.A. or A.B.), which refers to the liberal arts, and bachelor of science (B.S.). A bachelor's is required before starting graduate studies.</p>

	<p><strong>Campus: </strong> The grounds and buildings where a college or university is located.</p>

	<p><strong>Coed: </strong> Open to both men and women (often used to describe a school that admits both sexes and a dormitory that houses both genders).</p>

	<p><strong>College: </strong> A postsecondary institution that typically provides only an undergraduate education, but in some cases, also graduate degrees. "College" is often used interchangeably with "university" and "school." Separately, "college" can refer to an academic division of a university, such as College of Business. (See U.S. News's rankings of Best Colleges.)

	<p><strong>Commencement: </strong> A graduation ceremony where students officially receive their degrees, typically held in May or June at the end of the academic year, though some colleges and universities also hold August and December ceremonies.</p>

	<p><strong>Common Application: </strong>A standard application form that is accepted by more than 450 member colleges and universities for admissions. Students can complete the form online or in print and submit copies to any of the participating colleges, rather than filling out individual forms for each school. However, international students will typically need to submit additional application materials unique to each college.</p>

	<p><strong>Community college: </strong>A public, two-year postsecondary institution that offers the associate degree. Also known as a "junior college." Community colleges typically provide a transfer program, allowing students to transfer to a four-year school to complete their bachelor's degree, and a career program, which provides students with a vocational degree.</p>

	<p><strong>Conditional admission: </strong>An acceptance to a college or university that is dependent on the student first completing coursework or meeting specific criteria before enrollment. For an international student, this can include a requirement to attain a certain level of English-language proficiency if the student's TOEFL score doesn't meet the minimum required.</p>

	<p><strong>Core requirements: </strong>Mandatory courses that students are required to complete to earn a degree.</p>

	<p><strong>Course: </strong>A regularly scheduled class on a particular subject. Each college or university offers degree programs that consist of a specific number of required and elective courses.</p>

	<p><strong>Course load: </strong>The number of courses or credits a student takes during a specific term.</p>

	<p><strong>Credits: </strong>Units that a school uses to indicate that a student has completed and passed courses that are required for a degree. Each school defines the total number and types of credits necessary for degree completion, with every course being assigned a value in terms of "credits," "credit hours," or "units."</p>

	<p><strong>Culture shock: </strong>Feelings of uncertainty, confusion, or anxiety that can occur when adjusting to a new country and culture that may be very different from your own. International students may also experience "reverse culture shock" upon returning to their home country, after they have become accustomed to the new country and culture.</p>

	<p><strong>Curriculum: </strong>A program of study made up of a set of courses offered by a school.</p>

<h4>Why Getting A Liberal Arts College Education Is Not A Mistake</h4>
<p><strong>Jessica Kleiman, Contributor</strong></p>

<p>Last weekend, I read an op-ed by Thomas Friedman in The New York Times which featured Part 2 of an interview with Laszlo Bock, the head of hiring at Google. Bock has some strong opinions on whether or not prospective employees really need to go to college. His philosophy: Those who choose to attend a university after high school should think long and hard about what they want to do for a living and select his or her major wisely, focusing on skills that will land them a job post-graduation.</p>

<p>While I certainly agree that college nowadays is a costly investment and that graduates need to find ways to stand out to prospective employers in a highly competitive job market, I have a problem with Bock’s theory. Namely, he is asking kids of 18 or 19 to pick an area of academic concentration based less on their interests than on what fields are hiring the most people. In fact, two of those knowledge sets–computer science and computer engineering–are what a company like Google GOOG +0.54% might value, but what about all the non-technology companies in the world who look for able talent? Are people who choose to pursue a liberal arts degree any less skilled or desirable in the marketplace?</p>

<p>When referencing an article he read a few years ago in the Wall Street Journal, Bock says that a student who had switched from electrical and computer engineering to a major in psychology and would focus on a career in public relations and human resources versus technology “was making a mistake.” When I went to college in the 90s, you were allowed to enjoy the experience–it was about being part of something, soaking up life on campus, meeting new people, participating in extracurricular activities, and choosing to study something that excited and interested you. When I landed an internship at a magazine the summer after my sophomore year, I was the only one of all my friends to have an internship at such a young age. Back then, most people–if they did one at all–interned the summer before their senior year to get a taste of an industry before deciding what kind of career to pursue. Now, every entry-level resume I receive has a laundry list of internships — so many that I’m often amazed that these kids had any time to study at all. But in a way, the internships on a job-seekers’ resumes makes them more desirable candidates than what they studied or what GPA they graduated with.</p>

<p>The valuable, real-world work experience that internships provide often arm young job candidates with knowledge, skills and resourcefulness that college classes cannot.</p>

<p>I certainly understand that having a computer science or engineering degree helps if you want to work in those fields–and talent is in high-demand, for sure, especially since there are so many young, tech-savvy programmers today that would rather launch their own app or website than go work for Apple or Facebook. Some of them even forgo college–and that’s okay. It’s a personal choice and, as we all know, many enormously successful people–from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg to Oprah–were dropouts (though I’d be curious to know how many more have failed and now have no degree to fall back on).</p>

<p>But what is most unsettling about the advice given in the Times article is that we, as a culture of competition, are so hyper-focused on career success that we lose sight of all the other things that make a person interesting, well-rounded and, ultimately, a good hire. How sad would it be if, in 10 or 20 years, colleges had to shut down their English, Comparative Literature and History departments because students were only choosing to study topics that would help them land a job at Google?</p>

<p>With thousands of college students across the country nearing Graduation Day, I think about the incredible liberal arts education I received at the University of Michigan. While the school has a well-respected computer engineering program and a stellar business school, I chose to study Communication and English, two subjects that perhaps do not meet Mr. Bock’s approval. That said, the classes I took–ranging from philosophy and sociology to cultural anthropology and, yes, even statistics (though I must admit I got through Michigan without ever taking a Calculus class)–fueled my curiosity, strengthened my critical thinking and writing skills and made me knowledgeable on a variety of subjects. And my internships at a magazine, a PR firm and a record company gave me the practical experience to pursue a career in writing and communications. I didn’t feel I made a “mistake” in choosing that path. In fact, I am now an executive vice president of communications at a media company–so I guess that degree came in handy.</p>

<p>As technology is ever-growing, finding good  programmers, developers and web designers can be a huge challenge, so I’m all for growing that talent pool. But as the job market improves, other industries will need skilled new employees as well, and if students entering college are being told to focus on the fields that have the most opportunities, then every other type of job will ultimately have too few candidates to choose from.
My advice: Do what you love, study what interests you, get good internships, connect with as many people as possible who might help you land a job, be willing to work hard and be resourceful–and you’ll be fine, whether or not you know how to build an app or program a computer.</p>

<h4>10 Best Values in Liberal Arts Colleges, 2014</h4>

<p>Liberal arts colleges focus on undergraduate education. They typically have smaller enrollments than universities and focus on bachelor’s degrees.
All the liberal arts colleges on our top-100 list represent Kiplinger’s definition of value -- a combination of academic quality and affordability.
These ten institutions stand above the rest for their academic excellence and generous financial aid. (Total annual cost includes tuition, fees, room and board.)</p>

<ol>
	
<li>
	<p><strong>Washington and Lee University</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Lexington, Va.</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,838</li>
		<li>Total cost: $56,557</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $38,375</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $18,182</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This is Washington and Lee’s first year as number one for best value, after appearing in the top ten for the last six years. The school attracts top students -- nearly half of incoming freshmen score 700 or higher on the verbal or math portion of the SAT -- and the eight-to-one student-faculty ratio means they enjoy ample face time with professors. The school’s “speaking tradition” dictates that students and faculty greet everyone they pass on campus. An honor code lets students proctor their own exams.</p>

	<p>Washington and Lee’s generous need-based financial aid (up 7% from last year) gives it a rankings boost. Its non-need-based aid is generous as well, with an average $35,249 awarded to 13% of students who don’t qualify for need-based aid. And the relatively small 3.6% increase in total cost over last year (from $54,612 to $56,557) secured its first-place finish.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Pomona College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Claremont, Cal.</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,607</li>
		<li>Total cost: $58,580</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $37,611</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $20,969</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you’re looking for an Ivy League-style school among the palm trees of Southern California, check out Pomona College. Our runner-up has alternated between first and second place in our rankings over the past five years, hitting number one most recently in 2011.</p>

	<p>Credit Pomona’s consistent rankings success to its stellar academics. The 13% admissions rate is tied with Amherst for most competitive in our entire list of top 100 liberal arts colleges. And Pomona’s no-loan financial-aid policy keeps average debt for students who borrow to less than $16,000.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Swarthmore College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Swarthmore, Pa.</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,552</li>
		<li>Total cost: $59,080</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $37,651</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $21,429</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Last year’s number-one school dropped to third place this year. But that doesn’t mean this Pennsylvania college isn’t a first-rate value.</p>

	<p>The campus offers green lawns and wooded walkways along with plenty of internship and networking opportunities in nearby Philadelphia. An eight-to-one student-faculty ratio gives Swarthmore students plenty of access to professors. Students who borrow leave Swarthmore with about $20,000 in average debt.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Williams College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Williamstown, Mass.</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 2,052</li>
		<li>Total cost: $59,670</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $40,511</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $19,159</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Up two places from last year, Williams College beats every other top ten college in several categories of academic quality.</p>

	<p>Those measures include the lowest student-faculty ratio (seven-to-one) and the highest four-year graduation rate (tied with Bowdoin at 91%). Plus, graduates who borrowed have the lowest average debt of our top ten, just $12,749.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Amherst College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Amherst, Mass.</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,817</li>
		<li>Total cost: $59,714</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $43,424</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $16,290</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It’s tough to get into Amherst -- its 13% admit rate is tied with our second-place school for most competitive -- but the brainy few who gain admission are well looked after. A 98% freshman retention rate shows that most first-years stick around for a second year.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Bowdoin College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Brunswick, Maine</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,839</li>
		<li>Total cost: $58,650</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $36,492</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $22,158</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The winters may be cold at our sixth-place school. But most students stay with it for four years: 91% of Bowdoin Polar Bears graduate on time.
Competition for admission here is fierce. Bowdoin’s 16% admit rate means that only top students get in, and its yield (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) demonstrates its appeal: Almost half of admitted students decide to attend Bowdoin.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Middlebury College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Middlebury, Vermont</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 2,516</li>
		<li>Total cost: $58,470</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $36,245</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $22,225</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Sandwiched between the Green and Adirondack mountain ranges, Middlebury has the largest student body of our top ten schools, enrolling just over 2,500. Its January winter term gives students the opportunity to take an internship, study a single course intensively or study abroad for one month.
Middlebury’s $58,470 price tag is steep, but need-based aid makes a big dent in it for the 40% or so of students who qualify. Students who borrow graduate with $17,246 debt, on average.</p>
</li>


<li>
	<p><strong>Davidson College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Davidson, N.C.</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,790</li>
		<li>Total cost: $55,683</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $29,064</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $26,619</li>
	</ul>

	<p>About 20 miles north of Charlotte, N.C., Davidson has a competitive 25% admission rate. Nearly half of its students qualify for need-based aid. Unlike many top-tier schools, Davidson also awards non-need based aid: This year, 12% of students without need collected an average of almost $22,000.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Haverford College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Haverford, Pa.</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,205</li>
		<li>Total cost: $60,430</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $39,702</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $20,728</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Haverford’s Quaker roots show through its honor code and a decision-making process that values consensus, treating all voices equally. 
The smallest of our top ten liberal arts colleges, Haverford also has the highest total cost of our top ten. It eases the tuition burden with substantial need-based aid, awarding students almost $40,000 this year, on average. Haverford has a strong graduation rate: 90% of students collect a diploma within four years. The average debt among students who borrow is about $14,000, significantly below the $27,000 national average.</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p><strong>Grinnell College</strong></p> 
	
	<ul>
		<li>Location: Grinnell, Iowa</li>
		<li>Undergraduate enrollment: 1,674</li>
		<li>Total cost: $54,554</li>
		<li>Average need-based aid: $32,984</li>
		<li>Average net cost: $21,570</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As the sole Midwestern school in our top 10, Grinnell has a regional reputation as the premier college of choice for bright, motivated students. But its strong academics and affordability keep it competitive on a national stage, bringing in students from nearly every state and 60 countries.
Grinnell moved up seven spots this year, thanks to its admission rate, which moved from 50% to 36% (the lower the admit rate, the better). It also awards substantial merit aid -- nearly $14,000, on average -- to 44% of students who don’t qualify for need-based aid..</p>

<h4>President Richard H. Brodhead at the College Board Forum: The humanities report "hit a nerve."</h4>

<p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> Richard H. Brodhead is president of Duke University. The following talk was delivered Oct. 24 to the College Board Forum in New York.</p>

<p>New York, NY - I am honored to have a chance to address the College Board Forum.  David, I am especially pleased to speak in the first year of what I trust will be a long and happy reign. To my audience today:  you perform one of the most significant functions in American life, and I salute you. Since the military draft ended 40 years ago, the chief experience that people from different backgrounds go through together as an age cohort is the college admissions process. In this great transition, you are the border patrols and the crossing guards. As secondary school leaders and college guidance counselors, you urge students forward, help them visualize their options, and encourage them to present their accomplishments in a compelling light. Those of you on the college and university side enlighten students and families as to what college is and why it matters, help them make the finances work, and select and shape an admitted class.</p>

<p>Put it all together and the scale of the process is astounding. I'm told that of the 3.2 million young people who graduated from high school in 2012, about 2.1 million, or 66 percent, were enrolled in college in the fall. It matters profoundly how well this transition is managed. It matters to individual students and families, who regard you as holding the keys to life or death; and it also matters to the nation. Our wisdom and productivity in future are directly dependent on whether, in earlier life, the greatest possible number of men and women can get the education that lets them live up to their potential. If quality higher education is richly available, we'll be prepared for any future. If people don't get the full measure of educational enablement, we'll lose their potential and we all will pay a price.</p>

<p>Deployed as you are along the perimeter of higher education, you are uniquely equipped to register the hopes and dreams that drive the quest for college admission -- and, equally, the negative emotions that have strengthened in recent times. Never has college been sought with such desperate eagerness as the route to fulfillment and success as it is today; but never has such has there been so much cynicism and mistrust. You know the litany. College is our only hope, yet college costs too much. You can borrow to help pay the cost, but then you're saddled with disabling debt. Some colleges admit students with no realistic chance of completion, and they end up with the worst of both worlds, the debt and not the degree. But those who do graduate may fare little better.</p>

<p>Students may have learned little or nothing in college (journalists eagerly adopted this message from Arum and Roksa's Academically Adrift), and so may have no better shot at quality employment after they graduate than if they had never gone.</p>

<p>As you also know, however, the new negativism is not solely a media creation. At bottom, it is a by-product of an economic downturn followed by a recovery which has lacked the lift of a true recovery, especially for the middle class. Barbara Ehrenreich long ago explained that the middle class is that class that can never amass enough wealth to secure its children's well-being through inheritance.  Instead, middle class parents strive to assure their children's success by hyperinvesting in education.  When costs go up for families whose incomes aren't rising, and post-college employment prospects grow uncertain, this strategy comes under massive pressure, with its hopes shrouded by a sense of betrayal.</p>

<p>We see one result in the rush to hold higher education accountable for the value it no longer seems to deliver. When the President began a virtual campaign tour this past August, he sought to connect with the public's hopes and fears by preaching federal accountability for higher education. After the State of the Union Address, the Obama Administration issued report cards measuring cost of attendance, debt rates, and completion rates for every institution of higher education. Virginia law now requires all institutions to post the starting salaries for their graduates broken out by college major, so parents can know what course of study leads to what result.</p>

<div class="articleItem textblock" data-id="17">
<p>The anxiety that higher education may not lead to a secure, prosperous future is the great new fact of our time. There's no wishing it away:  if we are living through a structural change in the distribution of wealth and opportunity, as many fear, it will be with us for a long while to come. In this new circumstance, we have work to do to mitigate cost increases and teach the public the real facts of price and choice.</p>

<p>But that is hardly the end of our challenge. A peculiarity of recent years is that as the debate over the value of college has grown more heated, the concept of this value has grown narrower and more impoverished.  The White House website may tell you the effective cost of attending Dartmouth or Arizona State, and this is useful information, except that it leaves the impression that the value of a college education is identical to its price. The Virginia website makes it easy to calculate the benefit derived from attending any institution, provided you assume the benefit equals the salary paid by your first employer. As such reductive metrics gain ground around us, the friends of higher education have a job to do. Without ignoring or minimizing economic realities, we need to say loud and clear what the value of a good education actually consists of.</p>

<p>Now, there are many different versions of post-secondary education, some of which do involve learning specific workplace skills, and these may be adequately measured by near-term employment statistics and rates of pay. But much of American higher education draws on some version of the liberal arts model, which has an altogether different value proposition. Liberal arts education is not just a matter of requiring students to visit random unrelated fields and check the curricular boxes. Beyond its formal requirements, this education aims to engage multiple forms of intelligence to create deep and enduring habits of mind, an active, integrative, versatile spirit that's naturally disposed, when it comes upon a new fact or situation, to use existing knowledge to try to grasp it, while updating preexisting understandings in this new light.</p>

<p>The value of this habit of mind is not measured by income alone. It is, in the fullest sense, equipment for living. Its value is that it supplies enrichment to personal lives, equips students to be thoughtful and constructive social contributors, and prepares them to participate fully and creatively in the dynamic, ever-changing world that awaits them after college.  It's easy to see why people might get anxious about something so difficult to calculate, and might want a straighter line to the payoff. But the fruits of such education can only be reckoned over long time-horizons, as they enable people to rise to challenges and seize opportunities they could not foresee at first. The lives of successful people almost never involve continuing to do what they prepared for. As their lives unfold, they find that by drawing on their preparation in unexpected ways, they're able to do things they hadn't intended or imagined.</p>

<p>I am describing a situation where, thinking they are securing real value from education, people are tempted to pursue narrow and short-sighted versions of that value, and so short-change themselves and the world. One favorite target for those who want a bang for the buck has been the humanities. All federal research investments have been constrained in the days of high deficits and sequestration, but humanities budgets have been cut disproportionally. Between 2010 and 2013, the appropriation for the National Endowment for the Humanities was cut more than 16%. In those same years, allocation for the Title VI foreign language programs fell a whopping 44%. Shortly after his election, the governor of my state said that public dollars should support only education that leads straight to a job. If students want to study more rarefied subjects, he said, they should do so at private institutions at their own expense.</p>

<p>As David mentioned, this is my tenth year as president of Duke, but I started my life as an English teacher, and at heart I am that still. At present I'm involved in a campaign to promote the liberal arts and the humanities, and I want to share some lessons from this adventure. The story starts more than ten years back when, at the request of two senators and two congressmen, the National Academies commissioned the report called Rising Above the Gathering Storm. This report made an urgent, cogent case that to prevent a disastrous loss of competitiveness in the global economy, America needed to strengthen its training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It's a measure of this report's success that STEM has become a national by-word, and bipartisan majorities supported the America COMPETES Act.</p>

<p>Now, no one I know doubts the need for STEM initiatives, but one can ask whether the nation's needs can be met through STEM alone. When the National Research Council commissioned a new report on research universities focused solely on STEM fields, I voiced the thought that the humanities and social sciences, equally key activities of universities, needed to be included as well. That didn't happen, but later, with its own charge from two senators and two representatives, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences launched a Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, and for my sins, I was asked to be co-chair.</p>

<p>Inviting people to serve on this commission was great fun. We eventually asked fifty-five extraordinarily talented and busy people. All but one quickly accepted, saying the effort was important and well worth their time.  Among others, the Commission included the presidents of Harvard, Stanford, Penn and Notre Dame, the Chancellors of UC Berkeley and the University of Texas system, and the head of the nation's largest community college; also business leaders, military leaders, a former governor, a federal judge, the heads of major libraries and museums, an actor (John Lithgow), a filmmaker (George Lucas), and a great architect (Billie Tsien).</p>

<p>Over a year and a half, the Commission met for a series of highly engaging conversations. What was interesting in these discussions was that the most eloquent voices on behalf of the value of the humanities and liberal arts often came from non-academics. James McNerney, the CEO of Boeing, told us that high-tech manufacturing requires skilled engineers, but that beyond a certain level, people will not advance if they do not have a broader array of skills, especially skills at communication and interacting with culturally diverse others -- liberal arts training par excellence.</p>

<p>General and Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, who headed military and diplomatic efforts in Afghanistan, testified that in the globalized modern world, weapons can only do so much to protect national security. Equally essential are the understanding of foreign languages, foreign histories and cultures, and beliefs and ethical systems different from our own: classic humanities fields within a liberal arts education.</p>

<p>Norm Augustine, longtime head of Lockheed Martin and the principal force behind the Gathering Storm report, argued that collecting evidence, weighing interpretations, and making arguments are core skills for creative workers and good citizens, and that these require broad training across the arts and sciences. The Father of STEM said he thought America's single greatest educational deficit is in history, a prime teacher of the skills he cited.</p>

<p>Eduardo Padrón, President of Miami Dade College, reminded us that one-third of all undergraduates in the United States are in community colleges, where their aims are not exclusively technical. Miami Dade serves 175,000 students, 90% minority, more than 60% low income, many of them immigrants or first generation -- as Padrón says, "we take the people who can't pay or be admitted elsewhere." But even when these student seek training for a particular job, it's the broader training they receive that typically helps them to the next job -- with Miami Dade's liberal arts curriculum launching thousands into careers in public service, law, business, and education.  "If there is one area where the social sciences and the humanities are important," Padrón has said, "more than the Ivy Leagues, more than the Smithsonian, it is right there, where the masses of Americans have their first chance to achieve the American dream."</p>

<p>In addition to arguing for the utility of humanistic training, commission members across all sectors agreed that that the humanities need study because they broaden and deepen human awareness. Humans are the only species capable of entering into the hopes, fears, strivings, and wisdom gained by others across space and time, a radically enhanced experience available to us through art, music, film, and the written word. As humans, we can see, feel and know things we could never have grasped on our own by entering into the transmitted imagination of others, a magnificent expansion of consciousness. We turn our backs on this legacy only at the cost of condemning ourselves to the harshest of poverties: imprisonment in our narrow present, seeing by our own unaided light.</p>

<div class="articleItem textblock" data-id="21">
<p>After many months spent learning from one another, this summer the Commission was ready to issue its own report, titled The Heart of the Matter.  Like the report that launched the STEM crusade, this one aims to make a compelling argument for the public need for the humanities and the social sciences -- and to outline practical steps to advance the cause. The report makes the case that the humanities require support along the whole arc from K-12 education through college into community cultural life and lifelong learning. It also makes the case that the separate parts of this effort will each be more effective if they work together.</p>

<p>The Heart of the Matter first calls for a deepened commitment to literacy. "Reading and writing are the building blocks of learning, making possible all the rest of our education and development," the Report says.  "From being able to sound out words on a page, we advance to be able to analyze, interpret, ask questions, make connections, and express our thoughts in words. . . . Even in a digital age, the spoken and written word remains the most basic unit of our interactions, the very basis of our humanity."  If we are to expect any later development of this range of powers, we must lay a strong foundation in early life.</p>

<p>The Common Core Standards Initiative emerged from the National Governors Association while our commission was deliberating. While we do not claim expertise in the details, we recognized the Common Core as an attempt to institutionalize such a deeper version of literacy, where learning to read is not the end but the beginning of an unfolding process of interrogating the world and building critical thinking powers.  It is our hope (as it is the College Board's) that, started early and continued from year to year, this approach will bring many more students to the end of high school prepared for the higher-order work they will do in college. We were forewarned that raised standards would initially lead to lowered test scores, but the road will still be the right one if it leads to deeper enablement for many more people. When I asked his thoughts on the expected dip, Bob Wise, former Governor of West Virginia, said that when his high school football coach would make him lift heavier weights, at first it was hard, but eventually it made him stronger.</p>

<div class="articleItem textblock" data-id="22">
<p>A broad, cumulative development of powers rooted in literacy won't work without teachers who can live up to this aspiration. So as we raise the literacy bar, our report calls for a parallel emphasis on teacher training. This is a place where closer collaboration between high school and college and university teachers is needed. These two segments of our educational system are commonly separate worlds, each absorbed in its own task. But it's hard to see how high school results can be better aligned with college expectations if there is not more communication across this line.  Furthermore, higher education could help provide resources to enrich curricula and help teachers open their lesson plans for active exploration. Ten miles down the road from me in North Carolina is the National Humanities Center. It's a refuge for scholarly reflection and research, but importantly, it has also spearheaded an outreach to high school teachers through online seminars and toolkits of primary materials for historical inquiry. The different segments of our educational community will all be stronger as we see more cooperation across institutional bounds.</p>

<p>At the next level, the report is mindful that the distinctive American strength in higher education -- a strength envied and admired around the world and which many Asian countries are currently trying to replicate -- is based on a plan that opens minds in multiple directions, engages our curiosity in a variety of ways, and puts us in a position to synthesize bits of knowledge to form new insights. This broad, integrative training that reaches across the arts and sciences is the American alternative to the early specialization that many countries require, and it is widely perceived to support the nimbleness, innovativeness, and creative versatility that give the American economy its dynamism.</p>

<p>Public understanding of this model of education may be eroding at the very moment when this form of education is becoming more necessary than ever. So the report calls for colleges and universities to make a far greater effort to communicate the enabling power of liberal arts education, sharing this message in many ways with their many publics; and we call for colleges and universities to make sure they maximally deliver what we claim to provide.  Specialized curricular offerings can be life-altering experiences for students and are one of the great luxuries of a great education. But if we're to lay claim to developing the broad-based, integrative skills I've been describing, we need to take trouble to offer the courses that accomplish those goals, and to help students understand how course choices can build to a thoughtful educational whole.</p>

<p>I will leave our many further recommendations to your careful reading of the report, which can be accessed at HumanitiesCommission.org. I want to turn to say something about tactics -- that is, how we plan for our work to have an effect. Reports like ours can lie around unread, and many, perhaps most, have met this fate. But they can also make a difference, as was the case with Gathering Storm. So we were eager to consult Norm Augustine and other of our members who served on both commissions about the grounds of that success. What we learned was that, even after coming up with a persuasive rationale and a list of practical measures, there was a long interval spent carrying the message to multiple audiences before the result began to take shape.</p>

<p>That's the stage we're at now.  We were delighted that the launch of The Heart of the Matter received enthusiastic coverage in the media. Thousands of people visited the website to download the report, PBS Newshour and The Colbert Report introduced it to television audiences, and papers around the country continue to publish op-eds and follow-on articles engaging with its ideas.</p>

<p>To me this is evidence that the report hit a nerve. In truth, it's actually not a hard sell to remind people that literacy is the foundation of all communications and analytical skills, that citizens of a democracy need some understanding of history, that in a globalized world it's dangerous to know so little about foreign people and cultures -- and that STEM is a crucial component of a balanced diet, but not the whole of what we need; and that it's not only good for people to study humanistic subjects, but that humans naturally love and crave this kind of nourishment. (Why else does the Museum of Modern Art have more than a million followers on its twitter feed? How else could Oprah have managed to mobilize the Oprah Book Club to read Faulkner and Toni Morrison and Anna Karenina? What else could it mean that the Coursera professor with the highest enrollment to date has been a humanist: the philosopher Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, whose online course Think Again: How to Reason and Argue has reached more than 400,000 students?) So far from bearing an unpalatable message in the Eat Your Broccoli mode, we've been telling people something that made sense to them, indeed that they already knew and believed, or would have, if our public discourse was not so clogged with other, contrary messages.</p>

<p>Eventually, we will be looking for the federal government to play a role in support of the humanities. It's hard to believe this is an auspicious month for seeking new appropriations, but the de-funding of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which supports arts and history projects in every state across the country, is scandalously short-sighted. Restoring adequate funding for the study of foreign languages and cultures through Title VI and the Fulbright-Hays Program is another obvious goal.</p>

<p>But unlike the sciences, the humanities aren't fundamentally dependent on federal support; and to succeed, we will need to mobilize actors at every level of American life, including states and local communities. With the American Academy coordinating and in partnership with state humanities councils, our Commission continues to carry the message out in this way. Former Supreme Court Justice David Souter came out of retirement to lead one such  humanities event in Albany, NY. To my great delight, Carnegie Mellon University, the computer science and technology powerhouse in Pittsburgh, featured The Heart of the Matter in its freshman orientation this fall. Two weeks back I attended an event in Charlotte, North Carolina, honoring support for the humanities by two particularly active citizen leaders and a local historian who has given presentations in nearly a hundred towns. Three hundred people came, and they cheered loud and long. As I say, the humanities have plenty of friends, if we remember to remind them of the fact.
Meanwhile, in the wake of The Heart of the Matter, the American Academy continues to engage in mass dissemination of information, some of which might take the average American quite by surprise. Did you know that three-quarters of American employers "want new hires with precisely the sort of skills the humanities teach: critical thinking, complex problem-solving, as well as written and oral communication?"  Did you know that humanities majors scored nine percent higher on the Graduate Management Admission Test than business majors? It makes you wonder if useless things might have their uses after all.</p>

<p>Now I turn my eyes to you, members of the College Board. More than two thousand in number, you are today's evangelizing target for this great cause. I know you are besieged by parents who want to do right by their children and don't want to fall for a scam. I know you know the legitimate concerns and frequent economic pressures they face. And we all know that colleges do not always make it easy for students to get the glorious experience they've seen advertised, especially when their families don't have the tradition of navigating college and knowing how its value is extracted.</p>

<p>There's plenty of work to do to close the gap between the real and the ideal in higher education. We all need to be part of that solution. For all that, a great harm we can do to today's students is to limit their reach by siding with their anxieties and letting them settle for an education that's light on ambition. The great question of education today is how to promote the fullest realization of potential in the young men and women who will be the productive and creative citizens of tomorrow -- or could be, if their education lets them.  The humanities aren't the whole of the answer but they are certainly a part of it. The humanities are not a luxury; they are a core dimension of our humanity and a crucial basis for human power. You're all counselors of different sorts. Let's counsel students to build all the sources of their potential strength. That's where the value resides.</p>

<h4>Tuition</h4>

<p>The major difference between public universities and private colleges lies in how they are funded. This affects students because funding is tied to tuition prices. Most public universities and colleges were founded by state governments, some as early as the 1800s, to give residents the opportunity to receive public college education. Today, state governments pay for most of the cost of operating public universities. They also oversee these institutions through appointed boards and trustees.</p>

<p>This influx of public money is why tuition is lower at a public university. The real cost of an attendance is subsidized. Money raised from tuition doesn't need to cover all of a public college's expenses, such as paying faculty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, private colleges don't receive funds from state legislatures. They rely heavily on tuition and private contributions. This means tuition rates are generally higher.</p>

<p><strong>Size and Degree Offerings</strong></p>
<p>Another difference between private and public colleges is their size and the number of degrees they typically offer. Private colleges tend to be much smaller than public universities and may have only a few thousand students. Public universities and colleges can be big, and some are huge. One example of a large public university is Ohio State University, home to 42,000 undergraduates.</p>

<p>Students who want a wide choice of majors can find them at public universities. In a single large public university, undergraduates will be enrolled in academic programs ranging from traditional liberal arts to highly specialized technical fields.  Private colleges offer a smaller range of majors, but often have a particular academic focus. Some private colleges may emphasize the liberal arts or the fine arts, for instance, while others focus on engineering and computer science.</p>

<p><strong>Class size and demographics</strong></p>
<p>Class-size is another major difference. Private colleges keep classes small, with easy access to professors. At public universities, however, 200 students may be enrolled in some classes, especially in lower-division courses.</p>

<p>Private and public colleges also tend to have different demographics and ratios. For example, in-state students applying to their public universities are admitted in far greater numbers and pay lower tuition than students applying from out-of-state. In contrast, state residency isn't crucial at private colleges, which results in a greater geographical diversity among the student body.</p>

<p><strong>Public university or private college?</strong></p>
<p>You should identify your goals and consider costs, class size, culture, and environment before choosing between a public university and private school for your college experience.</p>

	<h4>Private Versus Public Colleges</h4>
	<p><strong>by Sally Rubenstone </strong></p>
	<p><strong>Question: Can you explain the difference between a private college and a public college? I’m confused about which one I should attend.</strong></p>
	<p>Public colleges are those that are largely supported by state funds. If you attend a public institution in your own state, you will get a break on tuitions costs, and–as a state resident–it’s usually easier for you be admitted, as well. However, if you attend a public college in ANOTHER state, you will probably not get those benefits (though some state institutions do have reciprocal agreements with other nearby states.) </p>

	<p>Private colleges, on the other hand, are supported by tuition, endowment, and donations from alumni and friends. Usually they are more expensive than public colleges, but it does depend on the particular school. Also, private colleges often offer the best financial aid (see below). While attending a private school is reputed to translate into less red tape and more personal attention than you’ll find at the public counterparts, it’s important to look carefully at each individual college and to separate rumor from reality.</p>

	<p>While cost may be an important consideration for you, don’t let that entirely govern your college choices … at least initially. Commonly, the more a college costs, the more money there is to give away. So, while lower tuition may make public colleges and universities attractive to you, don’t give up on the pricier private schools that may provide good financial aid. Ultimately, your final decision may have to be based on costs, but at this stage of the college exploration process, you don’t need to consider only the dough.</p>

<h4>The myth of the Ivy League</h4>

<p>She won the golden ticket: admission to one of the nation's top colleges. She soon found that too many students choose "the best," rather than "the right" school.</p>

<p>My first day of college felt like a dream. I stepped wide-eyed through the black iron gates into a paradise of manicured lawns and towering stone buildings, exhilarated at the chance to attend an Ivy League school. Everything looked just as beautiful as it did in the brochure, and I felt sure that I would soon be as happy and fulfilled as the students I'd seen smiling on the cover.</p>

<p>But within a few weeks, I encountered the unpleasant reality beneath my school's surface. The incessant competition. The endless work-filled days and tense, sleepless nights. The tremendous pressure to perform brilliantly in every capacity: academics, extracurricular activities, social life, physical fitness, and career. I felt like I was juggling bowling balls. But I couldn’t slow down, because no matter how well I did, it seemed the person next to me was doing better.</p>

<p>Then one night while my roommate and I sat in the common room bemoaning our crunched schedules and heavy workloads, she broke into tears. “I don’t know why they let me in,” she said. “I’m just not good enough.”</p>

<p>Her words caught me off guard. Until that day, I had thought that such feelings of inadequacy were mine alone. But I soon found they pervaded the whole campus. As I began my sophomore year, more and more of my fellow students admitted to feeling constantly overwhelmed. “I feel so worthless,” one confessed to me. “I would transfer, but my parents would never understand," lamented another. And the one that hurt the most: "Sometimes I think I’m going to have a breakdown."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these complaints are all too common across college campuses today. According to the American College Health Association’s 2012 National College Health Assessment, within the last year 86 percent of college students felt overwhelmed by all they had to do, and 45 percent felt that things were hopeless. More than 50 percent reported feeling overwhelming anxiety, and about a third reported feeling so depressed it was difficult to function.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, students at Ivy League schools seem to be having an even rougher time than other college students. Rates of attempted suicide at Harvard College are almost twice the national rate. And 35 percent of Princeton students said that they developed a mental health issue after coming to campus. What’s going on here?</p>

<p><strong>The blight of the promised land</strong></p>

<p>Every year, U.S. News and World Report publishes a list of the “best colleges in the nation.” Parents, students, teachers, and guidance counselors devour the rankings, yearning to garner acceptance to institutions as high up on the list as possible. Any school in the top 50 is painted as a golden realm of milk and honey, and high-achieving students are encouraged to set their sights on the promised land: the Ivy League.</p>

<p>But the practice of glorifying schools does more harm than good. It may boost the status of select universities, but it has disastrous side effects on students: those who aren't accepted often see themselves as failures, and those who are often feel so much pressure to prove themselves that they do, in fact, break down. I had friends who fell weeks behind in their school work from relentless stress, stayed locked in their rooms for days at a time, and even overworked themselves to the point of hospitalization. Some ultimately dropped out or took leaves of absence once finals period hit, reckoning it’d be impossible to both pass and maintain their health. For every horror story I heard, I knew two more friends who were one late paper away from falling through the cracks.</p>

<p>As a symptom of our larger culture, this dysfunctional level of stress exemplifies our destructive tendency to value productivity over health. But it’s also exacerbated by the traditional narrative that equates graduation from a top-tier university with success, and, by proxy, well-being. Parents and guidance counselors unwittingly perpetuate this myth by emphasizing high standards while overlooking another essential component of a great education: choosing an environment that supports the student.</p>

<p><strong>Toddling towards Harvard, no matter what</strong></p>

<p>Whether it’s first grade or freshman year, finding a school that fits is more difficult than simply aiming for “the best.” In terms of college, there's only so much research one can do, and as of yet U.S. News doesn’t issue personalized rankings. In the end, it’s often subjective ideas about education that determine whether we prioritize finding a school that offers not only strong academics but also the right culture and community.
I knew so many students at both my school and similar schools who struggled, like me, to find a sense of purpose and individuality within the context of a prominent (and rather traditional) institution. The problem wasn't necessarily the institution, nor was it our lack of intelligence or ability. </p>

<p>Instead, it was the mindset we'd been cultivating since kindergarten.</p>

<p>My peers and I had been raised by parents who taught us to try our hardest and do our best, so we knew very well how to push ourselves to earn the highest grades and exceed expectations. But we didn’t know how to take a step back and examine whether our educational environment was actually supporting our development as human beings. Once we had been welcomed into the ranks of “the best and the brightest,” we couldn’t dream of relinquishing the title we had struggled to earn.</p>

<p>The burden of expectation lay especially heavy on students from low-income backgrounds like me. Though I considered taking time off several times, I stuck around because I knew everyone back home was counting on me to stay. My teachers had put in long hours reviewing essays and writing recommendations. My parents had spent countless weekends helping me research programs and plan visits. And I myself had worked tirelessly throughout high school to build the perfect profile for college acceptance. After all of that, I thought leaving campus would mean giving up.</p>

<p><strong>Caught in the perfection trap</strong></p>

<p>High standards are important. Aspirations can make the difference between a student floundering or reaching her full potential. The trouble with high-achieving students is that their broad range of abilities can crowd out the unique interests that drive individuals toward passionate, fulfilling lives. Students themselves can get caught in a praise-seeking trap, especially if they're consistently rewarded for right answers rather than genuine interest or hard work. But just because a student has the perfect grades or a profile studded with stellar achievements doesn’t mean an elite university is the best place for them. If anything, it means the opposite: that they have the drive to succeed anywhere, and that if placed in an environment that suits them, they’ll be both happy and successful.</p>

<p>My conversations with roommates and friends over the course of my time in college reminded me how important it is to measure success with the right metrics. Even talking to my peers who were the most “successful” by all external standards — snagging scholarships, winning awards, landing coveted jobs — I heard undertones of emptiness and sadness that suggested they weren’t truly fulfilled.</p>

<p><strong>A different measure of success</strong></p>

<p>At the start of my freshman year, my guiding questions were centered on achievement: am I pushing myself hard enough? Am I doing as much as I can be doing? By junior year, I had a flourishing schedule that could’ve been featured in the university prospectus. But then, one by one, the bowling balls I was juggling came crashing down. Between researching materials for my thesis, directing a singing group, coordinating events for three different clubs, applying to summer internships, picking up extra work shifts at the library, and running to the gym between classes, I had no time to breathe, much less contain my acute levels of anxiety.</p>

<p>The night before midterms found me weeping deliriously on my dorm bed, calling my old roommate to come over now because I didn’t know where else to turn. With lots of support from my friends and parents, I quit everything except for my classes and my federal work-study job, got a few C’s (The horror!) on exams, and curtailed my internship search in favor of more sleep. After that experience, I gradually learned to measure my success in broader ways: am I taking care of my physical and mental health? Am I pursuing goals that seem right to me? By focusing on what mattered most, I made it through senior year the happiest I’d ever been.</p>

<p>Asking these more nuanced questions is something every child should learn to do as part of growing up. But parents are the ones who sow the seeds for these thoughts. More than just motivating their children to achieve, parents need to instill values of health, passion, and integrity. It’s not about lowering your expectations — it's about tempering them with a knowledge of your child.</p>

<p><strong>It's not just Tiger moms</strong></p>

<p>For many parents, this may seem redundant. We think that as long as we don’t resort to “extreme parenting,” monitoring our child’s every move, they’ll do okay. But it’s important to remember how easily children internalize expectations. They observe what the adults in their life pay attention to most, and from there infer where their values lie. For their part, my parents never insisted that I make perfect grades or finish high school at the top of my class. But with every 'A' I brought home from school, I noticed the smiles on their faces and heard their words of praise.</p>

<p>I learned quickly that if good grades were the way to win their approval, all I had to do was work hard in school and everything would be all right. Turns out, that's not the case; but from my parents’ behavior, I would never have known.</p>

<p>Parents of high achievers need to make especially sure to be vocal about how much their children’s overall health matters to them. Most parents understand this intuitively, but they may not speak up when they notice an imbalance in their kids’ behavior. For example, by sixth grade, I had developed a habit of finishing each homework assignment to a T, which my teachers loved. But it started off a pattern of constant lack of sleep that affects me to this day.</p>

<p>My parents noticed, but they assumed that my high-level functioning meant I was doing well. I wish they would have sat me down then and said, “We see that you're working hard to finish all your homework. But it's more important to us that you get enough rest than that you get perfect grades. Why don't you go to bed early tonight?” If your child fights back, you might need to be more aggressive. To kids who have learned to play the system of evaluation to their advantage, this ultimatum is just as important as “No, you cannot have another soda.”</p>

<p><strong>Focusing on an individual child's definition of success</strong></p>

<p>Every parent wants to see their child thrive. So understandably, many parents dream of taking that photo with their son or daughter, beaming in front of ivy-laced brick buildings, diploma in hand.</p>

<p>But I have that photo. And it isn’t worth nearly as much to me as my understanding of my own talents and skills, and the knowledge that my parents support them. It took me a long time to realize that my success is based on my drive and not the name of my alma mater. This is something all students should be raised to believe.</p>

<p>How much happier would our kids be if we gave them the space to succeed in ways that make sense to them? The more we can do so, the more we'll empower our children to truly reach their full potential. If you teach your child to find inspiration everywhere, to work hard on the things they love, and to keep trying despite obstacles, they will not fail. Their success may look a bit different from what you pictured, but it will be your child's own.</p>

<h4>With May 1—Decision Day—around the corner, here are a few things to consider.</h4>
<p><strong>By Jeremy S. Hyman and Lynn F. Jacobs </strong></p>

<p>May 1 is a new holiday on the college calendar: National Candidate Reply Date, also referred to by many as Decision Day. That's the day by which more than 2 million students must decide where to go to college and tell the school of their choice. Some students will be choosing between a college that focuses on teaching and a university that emphasizes research. And many will think that a teaching college would always be the obvious best choice. After all, you're going there to learn, so why wouldn't you go to a college that emphasizes teaching? But there are some real advantages to the research university that might be worth your while to consider. Here are 10:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Top researchers can also be top teachers. It's often thought that professors who are serious about their research programs couldn't care less about teaching and/or are lousy teachers. Instead, many researchers carry their passion for the field into the classroom and are inspirational teachers and role models. Also, professors who do research generally understand the field better than ones who don't, so they can explain the material better to students—especially when it comes to more advanced courses and topics.</li>

	<li>Courses at research universities often incorporate the latest research. Faculty who are engaged in research are more in touch with breaking developments in their field. And they're more likely to include this material—including discoveries too recent to make it into the textbook—in their classes. This makes for more exciting and up-to-date courses that are a whole lot more interesting than courses that are a remix of what's already in the book.</li>

	<li>The faculty can be more energized. Faculty at research universities are often making genuine discoveries and receiving recognition for their work. Large salaries, prizes, publications in distinguished journals or at prestigious presses, participation in international conferences or workshops: all of these mean prestige to the professor and, simply, feeling good about him or herself. These good feelings can carry over to the classroom when the professor feels genuine excitement and meaning in sharing with the students what he or she has discovered.</li>

	<li>There is the possibility of internships and collaborative research with experts. Studies have shown that some of the best educational experiences for college students take place not in the classroom, but in their interactions with professors outside the classroom, especially in the context of shared research activities. Such collaborative projects provide chances for students to themselves become researchers, and even sometimes coauthors of published papers or copresenters at conferences, either of which is a major feather in anyone's cap.</li>
	
	<li>There tend to be more—and more fine-grained—majors. The large size of the research university may have its drawbacks, but one advantage is a larger faculty and a larger range of disciplines taught. This means that students get a lot more choices of majors. For example, at the University of California—Berkeley, you can choose from more than 300 majors and programs. Moreover, within a single field of inquiry, you'll find many fine-tuned variations: in the biological sciences at Berkeley, you can choose Integrative Biology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Immunology, Cell Biology, and Neurobiology. And then there are more obscure majors, too: you'll find Demography, Epidemiology, Media Studies, Folklore, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual and Transgender Studies, and Native American Studies. At a small college, on the other hand, you might find only 25 to 30 majors to choose from. Choice is good.</li>

	<li>There are state-of-the-art facilities for research publication. Research universities have to provide top facilities so that their faculty can properly accomplish the research required of them. That means that the university has to invest in larger libraries and other equipment needed for research in various fields. In addition, the research faculty are able to, and at most research universities are expected to, win various kinds of grants from government, business and other agencies to pay for research costs. All this benefits the undergraduates who can then have access to the fancy lasers, rapid prototyping machines, or whatever else the faculty is playing with. </li>

	<li>You can have contact with graduate students. The fact that research universities devote significant attention to training graduate students is often seen in a very negative light. Some people complain about grad students getting the bulk of faculty attention and, worse, about grad students doing lots of the teaching in undergraduate courses—and being inexperienced, bad teachers to boot. We don't deny that these can be problems. But undergraduate students can benefit from hanging out with grad students. Often grad students are willing to mentor and advise undergraduates about careers, and, yes, graduate school. And their devotion and serious involvement with learning sets a great example for undergrads to follow.</li>

	<li>You get a chance to take graduate courses—if you're up to it. For a student who is really interested and serious about a field, there is nothing more rewarding than taking a graduate course. These courses are more advanced and specialized than any undergraduate course, and they give you a taste of what it's like to play in the big leagues. And this can be an opportunity for students to make the critical leap from just mastering a field to actually advancing the field through their own discoveries.</li>

	<li>You could get an advantage for admission to graduate and professional schools. Graduate and professional schools tend to think that students from research universities will be better trained than students coming from smaller colleges, especially when the research universities have faculty members who are well known in the field. Graduate and professional schools put extra faith in letters of recommendation that come from professors whose names they know. It's the top researchers in the field who have the best name recognition. [Get tips from grad school admissions officials: Business Schools | Law Schools]</li>

	<li>You can network with distinguished and well-placed people in the field. Researchers generally have great connections and can help their students get networked with key players in the field. These days many researchers will take students with them to conferences and introduce them around. This is a great way to get established in a field and launch yourself in a job or career. </li>
</ol>

<p>One final note: We do not mean to suggest here that no faculty teaching at colleges are engaged in research and that every faculty member at a research university is doing research. There are fantastic researchers who work at colleges, and faculty at research universities who view tenure as their license to loaf. Nevertheless, in general, research universities expect faculty to spend a large portion of their time on research, while colleges generally expect less research.</p>

<h4>Small University Research Packs a Huge Punch</h4>
<p>July, 2014</p>

<p><strong>Converse's NSF research grant team</strong></p>
<p><strong>Science innovation needs small universities.</strong></p>

<p>While large research institutions hold much of the spotlight for science advancements, small universities also play a crucial role – not only in innovation, but also in developing some of the brightest scientific minds for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Institutions like Converse, where students interact with research professors daily and have opportunities to work collaboratively with them year-round, fill a niche when it comes to cultivating students’ individual interests and aspirations. And here, the undergraduate student research experience often more closely resembles that of a graduate experience.</p>

<p>Last summer, Chemistry professors Dr. Sheri Strickland of Converse and Dr. Ken Shimizu of the University of South Carolina were awarded $100,000 in National Science Foundation funding through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  The program supports collaborations among universities to broaden participation in research. The grant enables Strickland to immerse two Converse students in an18-month project to impact medical science by contributing to the development of healthy synthetic tissue. Students at the two schools work on different aspects of the project, with both graduate and undergraduate students participating at USC.</p>

<p>Converse undergraduate students Natacha Karambizi and Victoria Bobo base their research at Converse, and visit USC periodically to conduct reactions in laboratories there. Strickland values the students’ exposure to more expansive lab equipment and to working collaboratively with graduate-level researchers. “It enhances their undergraduate experience. They both want to earn a PhD in chemistry, with Victoria’s interest being in polymer development and Natasha’s in drug discovery and design.” </p>

<p>And yet, the Converse students enjoy a key benefit that is distinctive to the small university environment they choose for their undergraduate experience. “Undergraduate students at large universities have access to the equipment but rarely get the kind of one-on-one access to and relationships with faculty that happen here,” says Strickland. “The goal of collaborations like ours is to provide the best of both.”
“I see students who are curious, who love science and want to become a scientist...develop great scientific minds and gain access to top graduate programs in their field."</p>

<p>Strickland began cultivating her young apprentices more than a year ago, taking them to the Southeastern Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society (SERMACS) in Atlanta. “I took them for three reasons: First, to see others presenting the kind of research they will present. Second, to attend professional seminars and hear about research being done in different parts of the Southeast. And third, to meet a Converse alumna who is pursuing her PhD in physical chemistry at Georgia Tech – we all had lunch together, which gave Natacha and Victoria the chance to connect with someone doing the very thing that is coming next for them.” </p>

<p>Natacha and Victoria presented their work at an American Chemical Society Meeting at Furman University last April, and will present at the regional meeting in Nashville this coming year. Strickland mentors them through preparation, but steps aside as they take the stage.</p>

<p>The EPSCoR project team will submit several peer-reviewed articles for publication in professional journals after the project concludes, enabling other scientists to apply the group’s discoveries to their own research in this area.</p>

<p>“When I went to graduate school – as is often the case today – it was my first opportunity for the kinds of hands-on and presentation opportunities at that level,“ said Strickland. “Converse students get this experience as undergraduates. The Converse science faculty are working to sustain our summer research program so that stipends are available for students every summer.”</p>

<p>With full teaching loads and management responsibilities for their laboratories, faculty at smaller universities like Converse must also dedicate themselves to the continuous process of researching and applying for grants in order to sustain such a program. Converse faculty members are committed to their vision.</p>

<p>“As a department, we are committed to conducting high quality research and to providing students with research training that will effectively prepare them for a career in the sciences,” notes Dr. Neval Erturk, who serves as chair of the Department of Biology, Chemistry and Physics. “We not only require completion of a research project for graduation, but also incorporate research and scholarly activities into our curriculum. This develops critical thinking, quantitative and scientific reasoning, effective communication skills and information literacy.”</p>

<p>The difference for students is significant. “I see students who are curious, who love science and want to become a scientist – even when standardized test scores may not place them among the most competitive applicants – develop great scientific minds and gain access to top graduate programs in their field, says Erturk. “While academic records do matter, the aptitude for science and the determination to succeed are often the best predictors of success.”</p>

<p>One must look no further than Converse’s 2014 graduating class to see evidence that these students are making a major impact in the world of science. They were accepted into a graduate program in biomedical research at Eastern Kentucky University with tuition waiver and stipend; a PhD program in clinical health psychology at Eastern Carolina University with full funding, an assistantship, and a substantial stipend; pharmacy schools at East Tennessee State, the Medical University of South Carolina and Presbyterian College; physical therapy doctoral programs at Duke University and MUSC; and the marine biology graduate program at the College of Charleston with a teaching assistantship.</p>

<p>Current students are spending their summer as interns at Oak Ridge National Laboratories, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, MedEx Academy and The Greenville Zoo. They are mentoring girls at a STEM camp in Texas, participating in the Coastal Marine Education and Research Academy, studying sharks and sting rays in the Gulf of Mexico, and doing funded research projects through the South Carolina Independent Colleges & Universities grant program (where Converse students are among the highest funding recipients in the state). Recent graduates have also earned two Goldwater Scholarship honorable mentions in the last few years.</p>

<h4>Forged Transcripts and Fake Essays: How Unscrupulous Agents Get Chinese Students into U.S. Schools</h4>
<p><strong>By Justin Bergman / Shanghai July 26,2012</strong></p>

<p>Because many Chinese students have trouble making sense of the American admissions process, a huge industry of education agents has arisen in China to help guide them — and, in some cases, to do whatever it takes to get them accepted.</p>

<p>This fall, David Zhu will join an exodus of Chinese students boarding planes for the leafy, beer-soaked campuses of American colleges and universities. Zhu, currently a university student in Shanghai, will be enrolling at Oregon State University to pursue a bachelor’s degree in business — a dream his parents have had since they started saving a $157,000 nest egg for his education. But like many Chinese students who don’t speak English fluently, Zhu might not have been accepted without a little help. The 21-year-old hired an education agent in China to clean up and “elaborate” on the essay he submitted as part of his application. “Actually, the agency helped my application to some extent,” he says.</p>

<p>Stories like Zhu’s are becoming increasingly common as the ranks of Chinese students going abroad for college continue to swell. Because many Chinese students have only basic knowledge of foreign universities and have trouble making sense of complicated applications, a huge industry of education agents has arisen in the country to help guide them — and, in some cases, to do whatever it takes to get them accepted. This has created a thorny ethical dilemma in the U.S. While many American schools are elated by the influx of Chinese students as they’ve scrimped and saved to make ends meet in the economic downturn, some educators worry that the reliance of Chinese students on agents has led to some unintended — and troubling — consequences.</p>

<p>Although Chinese students have been going to America to study for decades, their numbers have spiked dramatically in the past few years. In the 2010–11 school year, more than 157,000 Chinese students were enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the U.S. — a 22% increase over the previous year and tops among all countries. (Second-place India had just 104,000.) The largest increase has been among undergrads: China sent nearly 57,000 to the U.S. in 2010–11, up from 10,000 five years earlier. For the wealthy, an overseas education is becoming almost standard. A survey conducted by China’s Hurun Report found that 85% of rich Chinese parents planned to send their kids abroad to study. The U.S. is their preferred destination, followed by the U.K. and Canada.</p>

<p>While there are a host of reasons for this explosion, money and prestige appear to be the most important factors. Not only can more Chinese families now afford to pay the tuition at a foreign university, they also view it as a better investment in their children’s future. Universities in the West are revered in China, and homegrown schools — even the best ones — fail to measure up. “I think the college education in China is not very practical,” says Vincent Sun, another Fudan student who will be enrolling at MIT this fall to pursue a master’s degree in finance. “When I will be searching for a job, I think a degree from a very famous [foreign] university is a huge thing I think that will put me into a very good place.” Ironically, a foreign university can also be a fallback for Chinese students who don’t do well enough on the national exam, the gaokao, to get into a Chinese school — there’s always an American college willing to take their tuition dollars.</p>

<p>But many of these students would probably never make it to America without a middleman to pave the way. According to a 2010 report by Zinch China, a consultancy that advises U.S. colleges and universities on China, 8 out of every 10 Chinese undergraduate students use an agent to file their applications. And with such intense competition among agents — not to mention ambitious students and their overzealous parents — cheating is rampant, the group says. It estimates that 90% of recommendation letters from Chinese students are fake, 70% of college application essays are not written by the students, and half of all high school transcripts are falsified. “The world of higher education is becoming extremely competitive, much more so than it was even 10 years ago, and I think the kids are looking for an edge,” says Tom Melcher, chairman of Zinch China. “Everyone is looking around and saying, ‘Well, everyone else is cheating, why shouldn’t I?’</p>

<p>Another issue that concerns some admissions officers in the U.S. is where the money is coming from. Not only are agents paid by families in China — up to $10,000 before bonuses, according to Zinch — some American schools also have contracts with agents that guarantee them a commission for each student they enroll. This practice constitutes a potential conflict of interest, says Philip Ballinger, head of a commission launched by the Washington-based National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) to study the issue of foreign recruiting. “If money is first, then perhaps the interest of student or the person that’s involved is not first,” he says.</p>

<p>What’s desperately needed is greater oversight in China and the U.S. — something both sides are now trying to address. The Chinese government realizes that doctored transcripts are a problem: earlier this year, it launched a new service to verify students’ high school grades for foreign universities. But because there are literally thousands of agents operating in China, cheating will persist. “The Chinese kids, when I talk to them, they sort of think it’s the schools’ fault. The schools will say you have to have a recommendation letter from a guidance counselor, and Chinese kids don’t have guidance counselors,” Melcher says. Zhu, the student enrolling at Oregon State, says his agent didn’t falsify documents beyond the “elaborated” essay, but he believes doing so is sometimes a necessary evil. “Some schools in China test students by very hard questions beyond their abilities, so the scores students get are very low. So the students who want to go to the USA, they had to change their scores,” he says. “But the students are still very good students because they’re in the best schools in Shanghai.”</p>

<p>In the U.S., there are hopes that the NACAC committee investigating overseas recruiting practices will bring much needed clarity to a situation that has been a relative free-for-all in recent years. While federal law prohibits colleges and universities from paying commissions to recruit students in the U.S., there is no statute against doing it internationally. NACAC has a policy against it, but enforcement has been put on hold while its investigation is continuing. The group’s second meeting is set for this fall; recommendations are expected to come in 2013.</p>

<p>Although it acknowledges that fraud is a major concern, NACAC is focusing initially on the question of whether universities should be permitted to pay overseas recruiters commissions. Mitch Leventhal, vice chancellor for global affairs at the State University of New York (SUNY) and an outspoken pro-recruiter advocate, argues that agents can provide a legitimate and useful service for foreign students, provided they operate in a professional and transparent way. He says it’s ridiculous to suggest that universities should stop using agents. “That’s sticking your head in a hole. They’re not going to go away because market demand is there, so the best way to address it is to engage them and identify the good ones.”</p>

<p>Leventhal believes he’s found a way to do that. He’s founder of an organization called the American International Recruitment Council, which has developed a rigorous process for certifying international agents. Agents must volunteer and pay a fee for the service, which involves a third-party investigation of their business, an external review by two members of U.S. universities and a confidential complaint system. So far, the group has certified about 45 agents, who benefit, Leventhal says, from having increased access to U.S. schools. And after agents are thoroughly vetted, he sees nothing wrong with paying them commissions, so long as the schools are also transparent about it. At SUNY, the fee is 10% of the student’s first-year tuition. “No one likes to pay a commission to a real estate broker when we buy a house because it’s another expense,” he says. “But we don’t deny the fact that a real estate broker works on commission and deserves to earn something for their effort.”</p>

<p>This sentiment isn’t shared by everyone. Mark Sklarow, head of the Washington-based Independent Educational Consultants Association (IECA), says students in China are better served by so-called educational consultants, who are paid solely by families (not by U.S. universities) to find the best educational match for students. Dozens of consultants in China have applied to become IECA members, but the organization must first ensure they’ve never accepted money from a college or university and they’ve never engaged in fraudulent practices. He believes that as Chinese students become more familiar with the U.S. application process, they’ll increasingly turn to consultants like these to help them make decisions about colleges rather than put all their trust in agents.</p>

<p>Sklarow says the U.S. is at a turning point too. For the past five years, colleges and universities were “balancing their budgets on Chinese students,” but he thinks the pressure is now on them to find a way to regulate the system. “I think until American colleges stand up and say we need a way to guarantee that the students we accept, that the records we’re looking at are whole, complete and legitimate, the problem continues to grow.</p>

<h4>Educational Consulting Faces Credibility Challenges in China</h4>
<p><strong>The boom in Chinese applicants to US universities has boosted China’s educational consulting industry, but the industry still faces an image problem. by Joseph Luk</strong></p>

<p>China sends more university students to the United States than any other country, and for the last four years, the number of students from mainland China has grown by more than 20 percent annually. According to the Institute of International Education (IIE), an independent nonprofit, almost 200,000 Chinese students studied in United States in the 2011-12 school year, and Chinese students generated almost $4 billion for the US higher education sector in 2010. As more Chinese students have chosen to study in the United States, the educational consulting industry in China has grown in tandem. While the industry has been lucrative, it faces an image problem that experts say will force educational consulting in China to change.</p>

<p><strong>ASSISTING APPLICANTS</strong></p>
<p>Educational consultants charge a fee to help students apply to universities. This can involve helping applicants find undergraduate and graduate programs that are a good fit, guiding them through the university application process, and helping them strengthen their writing and test-taking skills.
In addition to standard application materials, such as general application forms, standardized tests, and personal essays, Chinese students must also pass language tests and prepare visa applications to attend US universities. These additional hurdles have made Chinese students a niche but fast growing client base for educational consultants in China. Though there are no official statistics on how many educational consultants are in China, a 2011 National Association for College Admission and Counseling (NACAC) survey found that 60 percent of Chinese respondents said they used education consultants when they applied to US colleges.</p>

<p><strong>DEMAND FOR EDUCATIONAL CONSULTANTS</strong></p>
<p></p>As more students look abroad for a college education, the demand for educational consulting in China has increased. For many Chinese students, a degree from an American university holds more appeal than a Chinese degree. A 2010 IIE report showed that Chinese students highly value the reputation and quality of US degrees, and that the United States is also the most popular destination for Chinese students studying abroad.</p>

<p>Some students are attracted to the US education system’s liberal arts culture, which offers students a variety of opportunities and degrees in different subjects. In China, students who want to attend a university must take the gaokao, the college entrance exam administered once a year to millions of students throughout China. The test determines not only if a student can attend university, but where and what they can study.</p>

<p>“In the United States, I could be an engineer or lawyer or doctor, but just a few points lower on China’s national entrance exam means I’m going to be a laborer,” says Mark Sklarow, executive director of the Independent Educational Consultants Association (IECA), a professional association that represents qualified educational consultants. “The ability to opt out of the gaokao just makes so much sense.”</p>

<p>According to China’s national entrance exam website, the number of students taking the gaokao has been declining since 2008. Meanwhile, according to the Educational Testing Service, in 2012 more Chinese students than ever took the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), a test required for non-native English speakers applying to US universities. In addition, according to Professionals in International Education News, the number of Chinese students taking the Scholastic Assessment Test—a standardized test for US college admissions—is expected to exceed 40,000 in 2012, up from 20,000 just two years ago.</p>

<p>Educational consulting is a lucrative market in China. According to Zinch China, a social network that connects students to US universities, 53 percent of respondents who said they were interested in US universities can afford to spend at least $40,000 annually on tuition. (For comparison, Peking University—one of China’s top universities—usually charges around $850 for tuition annually.) Chinese students are also willing to spend money to get admitted to a US school. Yani Zhai, an education consultant in China, says educational consultants can charge a student ¥80,000 ($12,800) to ¥200,000 ($32,000) a year for application consulting.</p>

<p><strong>INDUSTRY CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>While it is a lucrative time for educational consulting in China, a few well-documented cases have raised questions about who can be trusted in the field. In October 2012, the Boston Globe reported that a family in Hong Kong gave more than $2 million to an educational consulting firm to provide tutoring and funnel donations to an elite university, to boost their son’s chance of admittance. When he was not admitted to the university, the family sued the firm.</p>

<p>In other instances, consultants have written student essays with little or no input from the student, and other consultants receive recruiting fees to place students with certain universities, a practice that is banned in the United States. Zhai cautions against calling those individuals consultants, however, and says they are usually known as zhongjie, which translates to intermediaries or agents. Zhai and Sklarow both acknowledge that it is easy for schools and families to conflate consultants with those agents because both groups are hired to help with admissions. They explain that agents, unlike consultants, may not have strong educational credentials, help too much with applications, and often do not follow ethical guidelines. In a separate report, Zinch China interviewed students who claimed that up to three-quarters of Chinese students have other people—in many cases agents—write their application essays.</p>

<p><strong>RESHAPING THE INDUSTRY</strong></p>
<p>Sklarow says the IECA is aiming to address the image problem. To ensure credibility the IECA has a multistage vetting process. “We can confirm if someone has been approved for membership,” Sklarow says, “That means we checked their education, references, business model, marketing, campus visits, training, [and] quality of advice.” He says that the organization’s ethical standards are a premium that Chinese consultants can add to their resume if they are IECA-approved. The IECA currently has eight professional members in China and more than 30 associate members. Most consultants need to spend up to three years as an associate member—a provisional status. “Once we have confidence in their ethics and capabilities, they may become a professional member,” he says.</p>

<p>Sklarow expects the number of members in China to grow to 25 professional and 100 associate members by the end of 2013. The IECA is vetting 15 to 20 membership applications from China. The IECA rejects about one-third of US domestic applicants, about half of international applicants, and three-quarters of Chinese applicants.</p>

<p>Sklarow also says the educational consulting market in China is ripe for transformation and that new business models are being devised. For example, US-based institutions, such as the Princeton Review Inc., are looking at combining test preparation with language immersion courses for Chinese students. But a company with significant brand recognition in China has not yet emerged. “US affiliation often brings a degree of legitimacy in China,” Sklarow says. “US-based services are well positioned to catch up in a market traditionally dominated by domestic service providers.”</p>

<p>Zhai says she is skeptical that credentials alone will solve the image problem for consultants, because she says customer trust is built more through word of mouth. She says Chinese students and families need to change their values to force educational consultants to be more accountable. She says parents are increasingly savvy about what they want for their children, and are beginning to understand that the goal is not to just get into a college, but to get into the right college. “Our approach is to be more of a mentor,” she says. “We want the admissions process to be educational, fruitful, and worthwhile, and to best prepare them for an American liberal arts education.”</p>

<h4>College application cycle for 2015 begins</h4>
<p><strong>By Nick Anderson August 4</strong></p>

<p>In these lazy days of early August, many rising high school seniors no doubt relish a few more carefree weeks before classes resume. But some are now plunging deep into their college applications.</p>

<p>Indeed, a few have already filed.</p>

<p>The 2015 admissions cycle opened Friday for students using the online Common Application, which is a portal for more than 500 colleges and universities, including many of the most selective.</p>

<p>Last year, the Common App was revised and plagued by technical glitches and complaints about customer service. Eventually, most of the issues were ironed out. This year, the nonprofit organization that oversees it pledges to do everything possible to help students file on time and without hassles.</p>

<p>“With any technology, there can be hiccups,” Paul Mott, interim chief executive of the Common App, wrote in an e-mail to new users. “If a screen does not immediately appear or is temporarily unavailable, please don’t worry. If we can, we will try to tell you about this kind of thing in advance, but in all instances you can know that we’re always available, will respond promptly, and won’t stand down until the job is done.”</p>

<p>About 813,000 students filed 3.45 million applications in the previous cycle through the Common App. That works out to an average of about four apps per student, although many file far more.</p>

<p>There are alternatives. The Universal College Application is a gateway for more than 40 schools. Harvard and Princeton universities, for example, allow students to apply through either site. The University of Maryland at College Park and Georgetown University, among many others, use their own electronic application process.</p>

<h4>Important Common App Details You May Not Know</h4>
<p><strong>Posted: 09/08/2014 3:37 pm EDT Updated: 09/08/2014 3:59 pm EDT </strong></p>

<p>Based on the difficulties of the Common Application last year, so far this year, it's been a pretty smooth ride. However, there are a few Common App details you may not know that could save you time and aggravation.</p> 

<p><strong>  Common App Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The Common Application does not restrict the number of changes that are made to any part of the application except the essays. Students generally must submit to one college first before they can make changes. They can then add or delete test scores and revise the activity page. However, there are restrictions on changes made to the essay. </li>
	<li>The essay can be revised twice for no more than three revisions. This is a crucial point and one that often gets missed by students. In order to make changes to an essay after you submit an application to a college, students will need to unlock their applications. Students cannot make any changes to an essay once it is submitted to a college. You can unlock again up to a maximum of three revisions. Any remaining colleges would receive your last essay version.</li>
	<li>Recommendations can be handled for the student in several ways. The high school may still submit using paper forms (yes, there are those) but for the most part this is being done online. Ask your high school counselor what the recommendation policy is at your high school. If your high school uses the popular Naviance program, the student should know how to use that website and invite recommenders where stated. The Common App allows students to invite recommenders to fill out their forms directly online. Get organized and ask for recommendations early!</li>
	<li>The most confusing change this year is that although many colleges look like they don't have a writing supplement on the College Tab, they do! That writing supplement can now be found under that college's drop down menu under the questions tab. It is essential to comb the application thoroughly and look at every drop down menu, as some essay prompts may be more difficult to find. This could be overlooked if students are not aware.</li>
	<li>The Common Application will allow applicants to submit up to 20 applications. This would be an extraordinarily long college list for any student. Perhaps, if a student is applying to specialized programs like art, performing arts or combined medical, they may need to apply to more schools.</li>
	<li>Make sure you print preview your entire application prior to submission. The application must be complete before you can print preview. Give your self enough time to check for any mistakes and be able to make corrections before you hit submit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common Application vs. Universal Application: What's the Difference?</strong></p>

<p>Get help deciding between these two centralized college applications. The process of applying to colleges can be stressful. You've got essays, letters of recommendation, transcripts, and financial aid to think about on top of classes and extracurricular activities. The Common Application and the Universal College Application (UCA), run by two organizations, have tried to make the process easier. But what is really the difference between the Common App and the UCA? Is one better than the other?</p>

<p><strong>How are they similar?</strong></p>

<p>Truth be told, there are more similarities than differences between the Common App and the UCA. Both offer a centralized application system that makes the admissions process easier, usually. For both, you can apply online or fill out a hardcopy and mail it to the schools.</p>

<p>No one can tell you which application is best for you. But there are certain things you can consider before you make your decision.
Both applications require you to pay the standard application fee set by the individual schools. These fees can be costly but the National Association for College Admission Counseling offers fee waivers to qualified applicants. You can fill out their form and submit a request directly to the schools to which you're applying.</p>

<p><strong>How are they different?</strong></p>
<p>According to their website, the Common App's aim is to provide "reliable services that promote equity, access, and integrity in the college application process." Each of the schools pledges to uphold this philosophy. </p>

<p>The UCA administrators intended for their application to reach a wider applicant pool than the Common App does. So, they don't have a philosophy and they don't require an essay or letters of recommendation. The individual schools may require those additional materials, but the UCA itself does not require them. The Common App, on the other hand, does require an essay and letters of recommendation. </p>

<p><strong>Which option is best for you?</strong></p>

<p>No one can tell you which option is best for you. But there are certain things you can consider before you make your decision.</p>

<p>What schools are you applying to? The Common App is accepted by 488 schools and the UCA is accepted by 44. Some schools, like Harvard College, Duke University, and Johns Hopkins University, accept both. Certain schools, like Princeton University, have chosen to accept the Common App exclusively. So, which application you use depends largely on what schools you choose. </p>

<p>What about the essay? Some of the schools that accept the UCA don't require an essay or letters of recommendation. If you find that those two components are a hindrance for you, consider using the UCA. A study done by the Consortium on Chicago School Research found that the more schools students apply to, the more likely they are to find a good match and enroll. A study by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA found that as of 2006, 17.8% of students applied to seven or more schools. This is more than double what it was in the 1990s. </p>

<p><strong>Common Application vs. Universal College Application: Quick Facts</strong></p>

<p>ApplicationsOnline, the company who started the UCA, also created the online portal for the Common App. Since both online applications were created by the same company, they are very alike. So, you don't have to worry about one application being more technologically complicated than the other. 
Not yet a senior? It may be a little too early to make the Common App vs. UCA decision. But there are other things you can focus on, like preparing for the SAT and doing well in your classes. A strong transcript is one of the most important aspects of the college application for any school.</p>

<h4>More Colleges Join Universal College Application – Seeking Easy to Use, Accessible Application Alternative</h4>
<p><strong>May 7, 2014</strong></p>

<p>Brandeis University, University of Chicago, Colgate University, The College of Mount Saint Vincent, University of Rochester and Wilson College are pleased to announce they will be joining the Universal College Application (UCA) for the 2014-2015 application year.</p>

<p>These new members, along with the 12 additional institutions that came onboard with the UCA late in the 2013-2014 application cycle, represent a growing corps of colleges seeking a reliable college application service focused on ease-of-use, accessibility, and customer service.</p>

<p>"Brandeis has a historical commitment to access, and we are very concerned that the practices of the Common Application are poorly aligned with that outlook" said Andrew Flagel, Senior Vice President for Students and Enrollment at Brandeis University. "We are very pleased to add the option of applying to Brandeis through the UCA to ensure that we have diverse and robust options for students to apply."</p>

<p>With the ever-increasing number of online admissions application users, whether they are students or recommenders, colleges and universities need an intuitive system that makes the application process easier for both users and colleges.</p>

<p>"Running a large and careful reading operation, all I want to know is that the mechanics can 'disappear' behind a smooth, coherent process so that everyone--students and readers alike--can focus on the actual fit," said Jonathan Burdick, Vice Provost and Dean of College Admissions at University of Rochester. "Knowing applicants will have the option to use the Universal College Application next year is already helping me sleep better!"</p>

<p>New members University of Chicago and Wilson College also highlighted the importance of ease-of-use. "UChicago joined the Universal College Application because we wanted to provide a user-friendly application that reduces the stress surrounding the application process," said Jim Nondorf Vice President and Dean of Admissions at The University of Chicago. "Joining the Universal College Application demonstrates UChicago’s commitment to simplify and streamline applying to the University. We have been very happy with how easy it has been to work with the Universal College Application team."</p>

<p>Mary Ann Naso, Vice President for Enrollment at Wilson College, agrees. "The Universal College Application form itself and the processes that students use to complete the application process are not complicated and are very user-friendly. Those features stood out in our decision to make the Universal College Application available to students interested in Wilson College. We are extremely pleased to be a new member!"</p>

<p>"I am very excited so many institutions have chosen to join the UCA," said Christopher F. Warner, who manages business development and client outreach at ApplicationsOnline, the company that provides the UCA. "With recent events, it is clear that colleges need an application service focused on meeting their needs, with respect to both technology and customer service. The UCA was created to promote college access through its inclusive membership requirements and easy-to-use software. The admissions process is stressful enough, and neither students nor colleges need their application service to add to that stress. We are pleased so many institutions are joining us in our mission.“</p>

<h4>College Acceptance: How to Determine Your Hook to Get In</h4>

<p>If you're like a lot of people, you probably believe that getting into a good college requires you to be the "model" candidate. Maybe you wrote it all down and somewhere, amongst all your college brochures, applications, and financial aid forms, you've got a checklist for college acceptance that looks something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Grades:</strong> Take all the hard classes you can and get on the honor roll — every semester!</p>

<p><strong>Standardized Test Scores:</strong> Study hard and get a perfect score on the SAT/ACT and any other tests you need to take.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Get strong references from teachers, guidance counselors, bosses, or coaches.</p>

<p><strong>Application Essay:</strong> Be interesting and witty, but try to stay humble so the admission committee isn't put off.</p>

<p><strong>College Interview:</strong> Dress sharp and sound intelligent. (Practice in front of a mirror if needed). Perfect a good sense of humor and act mature!</p>

<p><strong>How standing out can help with college acceptance</strong></p>

<p>Good grades and high test scores are definitely important, but if everyone that applies meets all the same criteria that you do, then finding a way to set yourself apart from the pack is just as important.</p>

<p>When colleges make the admissions decision, they want a diverse student body of people with real interests and personalities, so as you get your applications together, don't just highlight the obvious. Show those college admission officers something unique about you because one thing they'll be looking for isn't specified in any of their paperwork: the hook.</p>

<p><strong>Unique attributes and the admission decision</strong></p>
<p>Your hook is a unique characteristic that sets you apart and makes your application jump off the pile. It could be a personal attribute, like your ethnic heritage, or it might be an unusual hobby or job. The key is that it's a little different, something that makes the admission committee remember your application and increases your chances of receiving a college admission letter. Some examples of possible hooks include:</p>

<p><strong>Personal Achievements:</strong> Perhaps you started a radio station at your school or served as editor for the yearbook.</p>
<p><strong>Special Talents:</strong> If you're an accomplished cook or a champion chess player, let them know.</p>
<p><strong>Geographical Diversity:</strong> Did you grow up in Alaska or spend a few months living in an exotic locale?</p>
<p><strong>Extracurricular Activities:</strong> Do you play the bassoon or belong to a square dance club?</p>
<p><strong>Ethnic Heritage and Socioeconomic Background:</strong> Are you a Pacific Islander, or the first person in your family to go to college?</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Qualities:</strong> All those Thursday nights spent running your school's chapter of Amnesty International look great on an application!</p>
<p><strong>Athletic Talent:</strong> Whether it's Tae Kwon Do or speed skating, athletic prowess demonstrates your commitment and discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy:</strong> If your parents or grandparents attended the school, let the admission committee know about it.</p>
 
<p>A good hook is either something unusual or something to which you devoted a lot of energy. So, unless you were captain of the football team, playing football won't necessarily set you apart. However, competitive kayaking probably would!</p>

<p><strong>How to decide on your hook</strong></p> 
<p> Remember, being focused is the key to success in the college admission process and receiving college admission letters. Instead of signing up for yet one more club or sport, or throwing up your hands because you don't think you've done enough, think about the things you do that you get the most excited about and of which you're most proud. Think about what makes you different from everyone you know. Then make sure to tell the admission committee about it in your application.</p>

<h4>Strategic Positioning: Your College Admissions Hook</h4>

<p><strong>All competitive colleges strive to build a diversified and interesting student body.</strong></p>
<p>In past years, most successful applicants were well-rounded high-achievers. These days, there is a growing preference, especially at the most selective schools, to admit high achievers who are also “angular” or “focused” candidates. These students possess a special activity or unusual characteristic that sets them apart from other applicants.</p>

<p><strong>Call it the — “wow factor”, “dazzle”, or the college admissions “hook”.</strong></p>

<p>With growing competition, how will you stand out from the pack and be offered admission?</p>

<p>The first order of business is to do a little research to figure out what your choice colleges might find attractive (e.g. female interested in engineering, male interested in nursing, community activist, entrepreneur, screen writer). Perhaps your choice university recently introduced a new major or multi-discipline program and is looking to increase enrollment in that area.</p>

<p>Match what the school might find attractive with your interests, talents and experiences. Put on your thinking cap and brainstorm with others. You’ll come up with something special or unusual that you can offer.</p>

<p>Your “wow factor” doesn’t need to be truly unconventional – for example, combining a talent or interest with either community service or a business and pursuing it with passion may achieve the desired result.</p>

<p>Use your creativity! Are you a wizard at card tricks? If so, maybe you can set up a weekly class or program to teach underprivileged or sick children. Do you play an unusual instrument or sport? Are you a talented vocalist? Maybe you can entertain senior citizens. Are you an internet guru? If so, maybe you can start a web business or build sites for community service groups. Are you an exceptional writer? If so, are you interested in writing a screen play or a book? Or maybe use your writing skills in a community service environment and write grant proposals for charities. Maybe you’ve started a community service project. Have you been employed and promoted to management level at a store or restaurant? If you love art, are you a docent at the local museum? Do you volunteer to teach art at a school or summer camp? Interested in bio-engineering? Are you taking classes and doing research at a local university or enrolled in a summer study program?</p>

<p>Whatever you decide, make sure your interest is genuine and your commitment is deep and real. College admissions officers are not clairvoyant, but they have done this long enough to tell the difference. Evidence of passion, leadership, initiative, commitment and making a real difference is critical. Try to make it a theme that runs through your high school activities, recommendations and application essays.</p>

<p>Once you have established your “wow” factor, you’ll need a plan to reinforce it and promote it. Make sure it resonates. The admissions people should hear about it in “surround sound” in your application, in essays, activities, the interview and recommendations.</p>

<h4>Extracurricular Activity Involvement Affects College Acceptance</h4>

<p>Colleges aren't terribly picky about how you spend your down time, as long as you're doing something meaningful. They won't know if you spend hours upon hours playing video games; they will certainly notice a lack of notable activities on your college application. But you don't have to have a long list of stellar accomplishments to receive a college acceptance. As long as you can demonstrate to the admission committee some level of accomplishment, initiative, commitment, and leadership, then you're on the right track.</p>

<p><strong>How involved do you need to be for college acceptance?</strong></p>

<p>You don't have to play varsity football or be elected vice-president — there are many ways to showcase your talents and achievements. But with so many programs and organizations, teams, clubs, and causes, it can be hard to predict what will make a splash to the people you most need to impress. Realistically, there are some activities that do tend to stand out more than others. If your accomplishments are a little more on the unusual side, putting together a proper presentation can help admission officers see those debate awards or rock-climbing activities more clearly.</p>

<p><strong>What colleges look for when making the admission decision</strong></p>

<p>When admission professionals evaluate your extracurricular activities, there are a few things they are likely to take into consideration during their committee meetings:</p>

<p><strong>Dedication</strong></p> 
<p>The significance of your contribution is often a factor in the admissions decision. Admission professionals often favor depth over breadth. For example, while Bill may attend almost every weekly chess club meeting, Sue organized a chess clinic and tournament at a nearby junior high, creating such a success that she ran a second one at a homeless shelter and persuaded local merchants to donate prizes.</p>


<p><strong>Leadership</strong></p> 
<p> "Evidence of leadership" is a phrase that comes up often at admission decision committee meetings, and it can be what separates you from someone who ends up on the waitlist. There's a world of difference between the student who joined the Geography Club and the one who founded it. The more selective a college is, the more carefully your leadership role is examined.</p>

<p><strong>Balance</strong></p> 
<p> While there may not be as much talk of "well-roundedness" as there used to be, diverse ventures appeal to admission officers who are offering college acceptance. If you participate in the science club, drama club, and tennis team, you'll usually stand out more than someone who only chooses athletics. If you're a good, but not exceptional athlete, put other things on your activity roster. Similarly, balancing school-related activities (clubs, teams, choirs, etc.) with those taking place elsewhere (volunteering, scouting, church groups, community theater, etc.) suggests that your horizons extend beyond the schoolyard.</p>

<p><strong>True involvement</strong></p>  
<p>Volunteerism is very important, and the key here is real, hands-on involvement. Admission people are usually able to differentiate between the candidate who spends every Saturday tutoring at a storefront literacy center and the classmate who spent an hour on the Students Against Styrofoam Dance Decoration Committee. The person with real involvement is much more likely to get that college admission letter.</p>

<p><strong>Specialization</strong></p> 
<p> You may be able to up your stock in admission officers' eyes by being extraordinarily talented in some area or with a truly off-the-wall interest or experience. Perhaps you're a prima ballerina who dances 6 hours a day, pirouetting all the way to Prague with a national company, or you're a downhill skier just one run away from a gold medal.
Stories abound about students who received college admission letters because of entrepreneurship by starting home-baked cookie companies or computer software services, and of prodigies who published their own novels or built fighter jets in the garage.</p>

<p>If that's a little far-fetched for you, remember that colleges also appreciate uncommon undertakings: hand-bell ringers and Morris Dancers, magicians, skydivers, or dog trainers. According to one admission official, "It's exciting to see unusual activities on an application — not always the student council, the newspaper, or the yearbook."</p>

<p><strong>A final note about the admissions decision</strong></p>
<p>You recognize how much effort went into planning the pep rally, how tough it was to sacrifice a season of soccer for a semester in Sweden, or how many lines you had to learn for "King Lear." But admission officers have heard it all before. Be sure that you present your extracurricular activities and accomplishments well, and differentiate between meaningful and minimal contributions.</p>

<h4>List of Extracurricular Activities in School </h4>

<p>Involvement in extracurricular activities allows students opportunities to develop skills in areas of their individual talents or interests. It also provides a new avenue to meet classmates with similar interests. Participation in extracurricular activities increases self-esteem, promotes responsibility, assists students with time management skills, builds socialization skills and is favorable to college entrance committees. Many students participate in several different extracurricular activities throughout the school year.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Focused Activities</strong></p>
<p>Extracurricular activities that focus on academic areas include the school newspaper, quiz team, science club, school government, debate team or journalism club. Each of these activities promotes academic excellence and provides students with an opportunity to expand their content knowledge outside the classroom. While building leadership skills, students will also learn the benefits of technical writing, keeping and meeting deadlines and public speaking. Students will also have opportunities to broaden their content knowledge about unfamiliar subjects by conducting research in preparation for debates or academic competitions.</p>

<p><strong>Athletic Focused Activities</strong></p>
<p>Extracurricular activities that focus on athletics include sports such as basketball, volleyball, baseball, track, softball, cheerleading, football and soccer. Some schools offer even more sports teams to join, and some students play a different sport each season. Being part of an athletic team allows students to learn important life skills such as cooperation, sportsmanship, respect, responsibility, leadership and dedication. Students learn the importance of working together, and many stereotypes and barriers are broken on the field. Participation in sports often results in lifelong friendships.</p>

<p><strong>Interest Focused Activities</strong></p>
<p>Extracurricular activities that focus on individual interests include the technology club, chess club, yearbook staff, photography club, dance club, 4-H club, drama club, band and chorus. Participation in these activities allows students to showcase their skills in areas of their interests while forming new friendships with peers who are like-minded. Some possible school activities might include performing help-desk duties for educators in the building, photographing school events, participating in plays and skits, playing a variety of musical instruments, performing in concerts and running school news programs.</p>

<h4>Cool Ways to Get Ready Outside the Classroom</h4>
<p>Studying for your SATs is smart. Taking AP classes is awesome. Making the honor roll is … well, honorable. But there are lots of other ways you can prepare for college while you’re still in high school that feel more like fun than prep work. We interviewed five high school students who have participated in interesting, meaningful and/or adventurous programs to beef up their college applications and life experience—not to mention their “What I Did On My Summer Vacation” essays!</p>

<p><strong>IAN FARRELL       Grade: 10</strong></p>
<p><strong>HIGH SCHOOL: The Colorado Springs School</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colorado Springs, CO</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTENDED MAJOR: Law and creative writing</strong></p>
<p>Ian likes mixing things up and has already participated in several special programs. Each year, his high school, the Colorado Springs School, offers two-week Experienced-Centered Seminars (ECS). In eighth grade, he participated in a winter survival program where they made snow caves—and slept in them! In ninth grade, he chose a trip to Vancouver to study Native American art and culture, and this year he was in the Iron Chef program, where he learned gourmet cooking. “The best part of the Vancouver ECS was getting to make drums with native teachers,” says Ian. “They also cooked salmon for us in the native way, and we all ate together.”</p>

<p>Ian also likes to joke about how he gained independence. “I got left behind at the hotel one morning. I told the teacher I forgot something in my room and he told me to go back for it. Then he forgot all about me and took the class away! I knew where they were going and walked a few miles across the city to catch up.”</p>

<p>This past summer, Ian attended the Center for Bright Kids Luminary Project at the Colorado School of Mines. It’s a three-week program in July and the students stay in the dorms. Under the program, students focus on one intensive course of study for 6.5 hours a day—the equivalent of one full year of honors-level high school content or one semester of college content. But again, it’s not all work and no play! The Luminary Project boasts, “As much as students think hard in the accelerated courses, they [also] play hard in this deepened residential experience.”</p>

<p><strong>LACEY MAGEE       Grade: 11</strong></p>
<p><strong>HIGH SCHOOL: Academy of Allied Health and Science</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neptune, NJ</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTENDED MAJOR: Premed and linguistics</strong></p>
<p>Lacey Magee likes to stay busy. The summer before eleventh grade she volunteered at Jersey Shore University Medical Center to get a glimpse of the medical field, which she plans to enter after college, possibly to be a pediatric cardiologist. Although she did sometimes have to file paperwork, she also got some first-hand knowledge. “I got to meet doctors and nurses from all different fields, talk to and assist patients, and even watch surgeries and autopsies!” she says.</p>

<p>During the school year, she volunteered at another medical facility, CentraState, once a week, and the Juvenile Conference Committee (JCC) program once a month. “JCC is a program that acts as a reprieve for juvenile delinquents,” explains Lacey, “where the juvenile comes before a committee and has the option to follow through with JCC recommendations versus going to actual court and having their crime on their permanent record.” Lacey says that the best part of JCC was learning about the field of criminal justice and law, and finally understanding the types of hard choices and decisions a juror must make. But there was also a downside. “The most challenging part of JCC was when the delinquents coming in were people I used to know, old friends who go to different schools. I had to make the decision either to listen to their case, or excuse myself from the case and hope they don’t look at me differently from now on.”</p>

<p>As for what she learned from the programs, Lacey has this to say: “I learned how to suture, take blood pressures and pulses, and make casts, slings and tourniquets. Additionally, I learned how to open up and talk with doctors and ask questions. In JCC, I really learned about the horrible consequences of making bad decisions.. I also gained a large vocabulary of law-related words, and understand the jargon more.” </p>

<p><strong>DUNCAN WOOD       Grade: 11</strong></p>
<p><strong>HIGH SCHOOL: The Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bowling Green, KY</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTENDED MAJOR: Considering a major in physics, engineering, mathematics, music performance, French or video production</strong></p>
<p>For his junior and senior year of high school, Duncan is attending The Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky at Western Kentucky University. It’s a public, residential program that allows high school students to graduate with more than 60 hours of college credit. And did we mention that tuition, housing and meals are free?</p>

<p>Duncan says that his biggest challenges were establishing a solid work ethic system and managing his time. The best part? “Having the independence to take whatever courses I want, whether it’s upper-level physics or symphonic band. Just throwing me into the fray and letting me handle my own collegiate workload allowed me to find out what works and what doesn’t when participating in university classes. [And] I learned to manage my time and form meaningful relationships with professors.”</p>

<p>And although Duncan admits to studying theoretical physics, mathematics and computer science on his own at home, he’s a pretty normal guy. “Generally, I go to class, decompress, work on homework and goof around with my peers,” he says. “In that order.”</p>

<p><strong>VALERIE BELL       Grade: 11</strong></p>
<p><strong>HIGH SCHOOL: Archbishop Wood High School</strong></p>
<p><strong>Warminster, PA</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTENDED MAJOR: Journalism and communications</strong></p>
<p>Valerie is pretty sure what she wants to study in college. In July 2010 she attended the 13-day National Student Leadership Conference (NSLC) on journalism and mass communications in Washington, D.C. Although there was a rigorous schedule, (a typical day was filled with at least one field trip and a class on journalism), Valerie enjoyed speaking with professional journalists and interacting with students from all over the world. “I learned about the importance of the newspaper in our society … the possible death of newspapers and that while newspapers may die, the common need for news is insatiable. I also learned about the growth of online journalism and about how social networking websites are affecting news outlets.”</p>

<p>Valerie says the NSLC program also taught her about independence and gave her “a real feel for how a college class is conducted.”</p>

<p>In addition to inspiring her to become a great journalist, Valerie says through the leadership workshops and other group activities she learned about all of the components that make up a great leader. “During the conference, speakers talked about … the leaders that we have thanks to the rise of pop culture. For example, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga can both be … acknowledged as leaders due to their influence on our society. I learned about the skills necessary to become a leader, such as the necessity of story pitching and the power of persuasion.”</p>

<p>This past summer, Valerie attended the Washington Journalism and Media Conference at George Mason University near Washington, D.C. It’s a natural continuation of her current work writing a “reality” section for the local paper.</p>

<p><strong>RICHELLE ROELANDT LU HOMO       GRADE: 12</strong></p>
<p><strong>HIGH SCHOOL: Rancho Cucamonga High School</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rancho Cucamonga, CA</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTENDED MAJOR: Biochemistry</strong></p>
<p>Richelle spent three years of high school volunteering with the Sacred Heart Catholic Church religious education program for children with special needs and disabilities. “The best part of the program was being able to witness each child improve and learn something new about friendship and love each week,” says Richelle, who attended October through May each year. “It’s the best thing in the world when a child with Down syndrome or autism recites a verse or sings a song that was taught for months.”</p>

<p>Richelle says that when teaching a child with disabilities, you must be more patient and creative with the methods of instruction. “In addition, being personable, amicable and sociable are [important],” she says. “[You] must be able to communicate with these students’ parents and assure them that their children have the ability to learn—though much slower—like other students. These are attributes I will forever carry with me to college, as I will need the patience to learn, the creativity to research, and the sociability to meet new friends.”</p>

<p>Remember, preparing for college doesn’t have to be dull! Sure, a summer program or volunteering can look good on your application, but your main objective should be to enjoy the experience, not add another notch to your credentials belt. If your school doesn’t offer anything, a quick Internet search of programs in your area should give you some good options. Be sure to check out our brief on “Finding the Right Pre-College Program” on page 28.</p>

<h4>Extracurricular Activities</h4>
 
<p>Every private school and most public school applications include a section in which you list and describe your extracurricular activities and honors awarded throughout high school. The purpose of this section is to provide the admission offices with a quantified perspective of how you choose to spend your time outside of the classroom and during the summer and your level of commitment to these endeavors.</p>
 
<p>Often, this section poses a dilemma for students, “Why does a college provide me with such a small amount of space for all of this important information?” The answer is that they actually glean all that they need from this abbreviated space. Choose your descriptive words carefully, list your activities in order of importance, and answer honestly.</p>
 
<p>The Activities portion of most applications (including the Common App) is divided into five principal areas:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Grade level of participation. Colleges are interested in activities since 9th grade; however if you have been doing an activity consistently since, say, the 7th grade or 3rd grade (like a musical instrument) feel free to indicate that.
	</li>
	<li>
		Activity. List activities both in and out of school in order of their importance to you, including summer activities – unless there is a specific space for summer involvements.
	</li>

	<li>
		Positions held, honors won, or letters earned. If you are a team captain, a publication editor (newspaper, literary magazine, etc.), or hold any kind of leadership position, this is the place to indicate that. If you have won awards for your participation in any of these activities, list them here.
	</li>

	<li>
		Do you plan to participate in these activities in college? To get a better handle on where you might fit into their community, schools are interested in knowing whether you plan to continue participating in the listed activities while in college. If you think you will look into it, check YES. If you are absolutely certain you will not look into it, check NO.	
	</li>
</ol> 

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>  Some students may think that you must include as many extracurricular activities as possible to impress college admissions people.  However, be aware: colleges/universities are looking for quality involvement rather than quantity.  They want a well-rounded student body made up of students who are vitally interested in particular activities and who haven’t spread themselves so thin that they’ve demonstrated no depth of commitment to anything. Colleges prefer, for example, the student who was a dedicated yearbook editor, rather than the student who dashed in and out of ten activities.

<h4>What Counts as an Extracurricular Activity for College Admissions?</h4>

<p>Extracurricular activities are simply anything you do that is not a high school course or paid employment (but note that paid work experience is of interest to colleges and can substitute for some extracurricular activities). You should define your extracurricular activities in broad terms -- many applicants make the mistake of thinking of them solely as school-sponsored groups such as yearbook, band or football. Not so. Most community and family activities are also "extracurricular."</p>

<p>The Common Application as well as many individual college applications group together extracurricular activities with community service, volunteer work, family activities and hobbies. The list below provides some examples of activities that would be considered "extracurricular" (note that many of the categories below overlap):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arts: theater, music, dance, painting, photography, creative writing and other creative endeavors.</li>
	<li>Church activity: community outreach, helping the elderly, event planning, community suppers, church-sponsored music and athletic programs, teaching or organizing for summer camps and retreats, missionary work, and any other activity run through the church.</li>
	<li>Clubs: Chess club, mathletes, mock trial, debate, animé club, role playing club, language clubs, film club, skateboarding club, diversity/minority groups and so on.</li>
	<li>Community activity: community theater, event organizing, festival staff, and many other activities that are organized through the community, not the school.</li>
	<li>Governance: Student government, student council, prom committee, community youth board (see Sophie's essay), advisory boards and so on.</li>
	<li>Hobbies: Be creative here. Read these articles on how Rubik's Cube or Collecting Free Stuff can be transformed into an extracurricular activity. Also, colleges are interested in your passion whether it be rocketry, model railroads, collecting, blogging or quilting. These interests show that you have interests outside of the classroom.</li>
	<li>Media: local television, school radio or television, yearbook staff, school newspaper, literary journal, blogging and online journaling, local newspaper, and any other work that leads to a television show, movie or publication (online or print).</li>
	<li>Military: Junior ROTC, drill teams and related activities.</li>
	<li>Music: Chorus, band (marching, jazz, symphonic, concert, pep...), orchestra, ensembles and solo. These musical groups could be through school, church, the community or your personal group or solo efforts.</li>
	<li>Sports: Football, baseball, hockey, track, gymnastics, dance, lacrosse, swimming, soccer, skiing, cheerleading and so on.</li>
	<li>Volunteer Work and Community Service: Key Club, Habitat for Humanity, tutoring and mentoring, community fund-raising, Rotary, church outreach, hospital work (candy striping), animal rescue, nursing home work, poll worker, volunteer fire department, creating hiking trails, Adopt-a-Highway, and any other work that helps the world and is not for pay.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lead On - Develop Leadership Skills for Life</h4>

<p>Today, buying shoes online is as commonplace as, well, buying shoes at a mall. But back in 1999, when 25-year-old Tony Hsieh and his partners conceived of the idea, it seemed almost foolish. After all, there wasn't any proof to suggest that it would work: Would people really buy shoes without seeing them in person and without trying them on?</p>

<p>But Hsieh (pronounced Shay) had confidence in his idea, and he persisted, finding and convincing a backer to support him in his endeavor. Ten years later, his company-Zappos-is one of the most popular online shopping sites and an innovative leader in customer service with $1 billion worth of sales in 2008.</p>

<p>When most people hear the word "leader," they associate it with a position or title: boss, CEO, team captain. But leadership doesn't have to be "official," and you don't have to be an outgoing extrovert to lead. Hsieh didn't set out to be a leader (he's actually rather shy). He simply believed in himself and his idea, and the rest followed.</p>

<p>The fact is, you can develop leadership skills in every realm of your life and in any type of situation, from the mundane to the heroic, without being a formal or elected "leader." These skills are important because they will help you achieve both personal and academic success in college and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>So, how do you become a leader, big or small?</strong></p>

<p>Have confidence in yourself. Are you making your own decisions, or are others always doing that for you? Are you striving to become your own unique individual, or are you just copying others? Leaders come in all shapes and sizes, but most of them have a pretty good sense of who they are and what their goals are.</p>

<p>Take initiative. What are you doing this weekend? Try something new: Plan a day of volunteering for you and your friends. Or simply organize a trip to the movies. Take-charge social skills will come in handy when you're trying to meet new people in college or network for a job.</p>

<p>Get more involved. Most leaders are passionate about something. What do you care about? Extracurricular and community activities look good on your college application, but they also allow you to gain more expertise in an area that's important to you. The more confident you are, the more appealing you are to others-and the more likely you are to get what you want out of life.</p>

<p>Speak up. Again, start small. If you disagree with a comment made in class, offer an opposing viewpoint. Even if others don't agree with you, they'll respect you for voicing your opinion. This skill will be especially important in the workplace, when earning the respect of your coworkers and supervisor could send your career soaring.</p>

<p>Show some respect. This may go without saying, but treat others the way you'd want them to treat you. Be honest and fair, and people will not only be more willing to hear what you have to say, but they'll also seek out your opinion and insight. </p>

<p>Even if you don't have plans to run a company or govern the country, developing leadership skills now will benefit you more than you know.</p>

<h4>The Essay</h4>

<p><strong>How are essays used in the college admission process?</strong></p>
<p>In case you are wondering, college admission officers DO read your essays! While a few larger universities and a few less selective private colleges rely primarily on courses, grade point averages and test scores to make admission decisions, the vast majority of selective public and private college admission committees actually read your college essays – every word of them. Your essay is your chance to “come alive” in the admission committee – to become more than a list of courses and grades, a set of test scores or a series of activities. The application essay, then, must communicate on paper what you would like a group of strangers to know about you. Remember Princess Lea (from the original Star Wars movie) as she is beamed in 3‐D on the table? You want your essay to “beam” you in 3‐D in front of the admission committee – so they can hear you, see you and understand your thoughts, interests, motivations and emotions.</p>
 
<p>Writing the essay represents the most time‐consuming and challenging part of the application, but is also one of the most important parts. Often the biggest barrier to essay writing is a lack of confidence about writing in general, and personal writing in specific. Many students start the process by wondering what colleges want to see and read in an essay. This type of thinking will not produce the best essay.</p>

<p>Don’t ask: “What does the admissions committee want to read?” Instead, the most important question you can ask yourself is: “What is it about me that I want to be sure colleges know?” College admission officers are most interested in knowing about you, your interests, feelings, reactions, insights, qualities and passions – to name a few—as well as evidence that you have excellent grammatical and written abilities.</p>
 
<p><strong>What makes a good essay?</strong></p>
<p>Every “good” essay should do two important things. First, the essay should be an honest and thoughtful portrayal of you – your values, accomplishments and goals. Second, the style of writing in the essay should be fluent and demonstrate strong technical control of language. Colleges are concerned not only with what you say, but how you say it. Your essay, teacher recommendations, and standardized test scores in writing (SAT I or ACT w/writing) are some of the ways you can demonstrate the good writing skills you have honed in high school.</p>
 
<p><strong>Here is some practical advice as you begin writing:</strong></p>
<p>Allow plenty of time to write. The best way to be a better writer is to write … a lot. Practice, practice, practice. Write a draft or two of a college essay this summer, or at least begin jotting down some ideas and topics to write about. Think about important incidents, activities and people that have shaped your life and your values. Keep a journal. Look over past essays and autobiographical papers written for English and other humanities courses to see if any material can be borrowed for a college essay.</p>
 
<p>Ask a trusted editor (parent, teacher, friend) to read your essay. This “second set” of eyes can be helpful in pointing out mistakes, offering an opinion about the most or least compelling part of the essay, serving as a sounding board as you work on an essay draft. Be sure you trust the judgment of this adult – teacher, advisor, parent, counselor – and are comfortable accepting criticism/advice from him or her. Be careful NOT to ask too many people to comment on your essay. You do not want to lose your own voice in the editing process.</p>
 
<p>Show AND tell. Be ready to use anecdotes and examples to back up what you say about yourself in an essay. For example, if you write that you really love children, be sure to tell what you have done to show that you do. At the same time, an anecdote alone is not enough for a college essay. You need to reflect on your experiences, to tell about their importance and influence on you, to write with thought and feeling.</p>
 
<p>Your essay can be a great place to “flesh out” some of the things that are listed elsewhere in your application, but don’t use your essay to reiterate things that are already spelled out in your extracurricular list. Instead, use your essay as an opportunity to describe one or two activities, experiences, etc. that have not been adequately explained elsewhere.</p>
 
<p>Be honest! Do not write or even imply things about yourself that are not accurate or true.</p>
 
<p>Write from the heart. Your energy, enthusiasm, interest and passion will come across loud and clear.</p>
 
<p>Write in the first person (I learned …, I felt disappointed when …) rather than the third person (One should realize …, It can be disappointing when …). Remember to tell the reader your story, not a generalized third party story.</p>
 
<p>How long should your essay be? Most schools state a word limit for the essay(s). Adhere to it. If you don’t, a school may think you do not know how to follow directions. Furthermore, if the essay goes beyond the word limit it may get cut off when you upload it to the application. The Common App explicitly states that the essay MUST be more than 250 words, and not more than 650.</p>
 
<p>Keep copies of your final essays and note which colleges you sent them to.</p>
 
<p>Check all essays for spelling and grammatical errors. Watch for subject‐verb agreement and tense agreement. Remember, spell check is NOT enough – as spell check will not catch “there” instead of “their,” “its” instead of “it’s,” or “right” instead of “write.” These mistakes can turn a good essay into a very bad one!</p>
 
<p><strong>What should you write about?</strong></p>
<p>It’s not what you say, but how you say it. Too often students feel that they must write about a BIG event or achievement, or even a catastrophic event, and they are intimidated if they feel their lives have been too “normal.” A student once remarked that she had nothing to write about because all of the family pets were still alive, her parents were still married to one another and she had never had a serious illness. You may be surprised to learn that some of the best essays are written about small, everyday occurrences. Think small, think personal, think YOU! Any topic of real interest to you that allows you to show (with examples and anecdotes) and tell (with emotion) can make for a good essay.  Some possibilities include:</p>
 
<p><strong>Autobiographical</strong> – think of an event, series of connected moments, a person that had a powerful impact on you, a happening that shaped who you are now. Be careful of the obvious and simplistic (how my trip to Spain taught me to be independent; how my team’s state championship taught me perseverance), as those do not tell a great deal about you as an individual.</p>
 
<p><strong>Social or political interests</strong> – think of a political cause or social idea that you care about. This essay is most effective and most interesting if you can tie the topic to some of your other interests and activities.</p>
 
<p><strong>Academic/intellectual interests</strong> – think of a particular topic, research idea, author that you have studied or pursued in depth and that has had a powerful effect on you. (NOTE: Do not try to “fake” this kind of essay!) Be sure to explain how you were drawn to this topic and how you followed the concept beyond the initial spark of interest.</p>
 
<p><strong>Are there topics to avoid?</strong></p>
 
<p>In a word, YES! Here are some topics you are advised to steer clear of:</p>
 
<p><strong>Your boyfriend/girlfriend</strong> – not an appropriate college essay topic (trust us!)</p>
 
<p><strong>Controversial political or religious topics written to shock the reader</strong> - These topics are best saved for the college classroom.</p>
 
<p><strong>Your greatest athletic achievement</strong> – unless there is truly a fascinating twist or connection to your life in this story, an essay about an athletic contest will tend to sound a great deal like many others on the same topic.</p>
 
<p><strong>Any topic with sexual, racial or ethnic overtones</strong> — a college essay is not the place to discuss these sensitive topics, no matter your strong feelings.</p>
 
<p><strong>Your summer trip to Europe, Australia, Costa Rica, etc.</strong> – even though your trip may have been a very important moment in your personal development, it is probably the most common kind of essay that college admission officers receive (this is especially true if your trip was more travel than study or service). If you feel strongly about your trip, be sure you have a unique angle or that you tie your experiences to a personal interest or activity (example: your summer in Spain led to your increased involvement in the local Hispanic community).</p>
 
<p><strong>Anything that seems too obvious or universal</strong> – if you are asked to write about an influential book or person, avoid choosing an obvious topic. Don’t choose the Bible or a book read in an English or history course. (The most common book mentioned in college essays is the Bible; second is Catcher in the Rye). Stay away from strong references to religious figures (Jesus, God) or popular fictional or entertainment characters (Huck Finn, Michael Jordan, Madonna … need I go on!)</p>
 
<p><strong>What are some popular essay questions?</strong></p>
 
<p>Common Application Essay Questions for 2014‐2015:</p>
<p>Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.</p>
 
<p>Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what lessons did you learn?</p>
 
<p>Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?</p>
 
<p>Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you?</p>
 
<p>Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal,that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.</p>
 
<p>Essay questions are generally very open‐ended so that you can write about any idea or topic in which you have an interest.</p>
 
<p><strong>Still stumped?</strong></p>
 
<p>Relax! The possibilities for essay questions and responses are endless. Brainstorm ideas with your parents, teachers, advisor, and college counselor. Don’t let the questions stump you. Instead, remember that the central purpose of the essay – regardless of the specific question—is to let the admission committee get to know you beyond your academic statistics and activities list. Remember to: be honest, tell your story and show with examples, write in the first person, and write with enthusiasm and confidence! Remember, no one else can tell YOUR story!</p>

<h4>Sample College Admission Essays</h4>
<p>This section contains five sample college essays:</p>

<p><strong>Stanford Application</strong></p>
<p>When I look at this picture of myself, I realize how much I've grown and changed, not only physically, but also mentally as a person in the last couple of years. Less than one month after this photograph was taken, I arrived at the [school' s name] in [school' s location] without any idea of what to expect. I entered my second year of high school as an innocent thirteen year-old who was about a thousand miles from home and was a new member of not the sophomore, but “lower-middle” class. Around me in this picture are the things which were most important in my life at the time: studying different types of cars and planes, following Michael Jordan' s latest move, and seeing the latest blockbuster show like “Phantom of the Opera” or “Jurassic Park”. On my t-shirt is the rest of my life- tennis. Midway through my senior year at the special [school' s name] school, the focuses in my life have changed dramatically.</p>

<p>If there is one common occurrence which takes place for every single person in the diverse student body at [school' s name], it is that we all grow up much faster for having lived there. I do not know whether this speeding up of the maturing process is generally good or bad, but I definitely have benefited.</p>

<p>The classroom has become a whole different realm for me. Before, the teachers and students alike preached the importance of learning, but it was implicitly obvious that the most important concern was grades. At [school' s name] teachers genuinely believe that learning is the most importance objective and deeply encourage us to collaborate with each other and make use of all resources that we may find. In fact, in a certain class this year, my teacher assigned us to prepare every day of the week to discuss a certain book; there were only two require-ments in this preparation- we had to maximize our sources, gleaning from everything and everyone in the school, but we were not allowed to actually look at the book. As a result, I know more about that book than any other that I have actually read. It is teaching methods such as this which ensure that we will learn more. Indeed, this matter of “thinking” has been one of the most important aspects of my experience. Whether in Physics or English, I' m required to approach every problem and idea independently and creatively rather than just regurgitate the teacher' s words. In discussion with fellow students both inside and outside of class, the complex thoughts flowing through everyone' s brain is evident.</p>

<p>However, I believe that the most important concepts that I have espoused in being independent of my parents for half of each year, deal with being a cosmopolitan person. The school' s faculty and students are conscious about keeping all of the kids' attention from being based on the school. Every single issue of global concern is brought forth by one group or another whether it be a faculty member, publication, ethnic society, or individual student. Along with being aware of issues of importance, after attending [school' s name] my personality has evolved. First, my mannerisms have grown: the school stresses giving respect to everyone and everything. Our former headmaster often said, “Character can be measured not by one' s interaction with people who are better off than him or herself, but by one' s interactions with those who are worse off.” The other prime goal of the school' s community is to convert every single timid lower-classman into a loud, rambunctious senior. Basically, if you have an opinion about something, it is wrong not to voice that opinion. Of course, being obnoxious is not the idea. The key is to become a master of communication with teachers, fellow students, all of who are a part of the community, and most importantly, those who are outside of the community.</p>

<p>I do not want to make [school' s name] sound as if it produces the perfect students, because it doesn't. But the school deserves a lot of credit for its efforts. Often, some part of the mold does remain. As the college experience approaches, I am still the same person, only modified to better maximize my talents. Although I still have some time to play tennis and see movies, perhaps one of the few similarities between this photograph and me now is my smile.</p>

<p><em>** ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE COMMENTS **</em></p>
<p>This essay is fairly well written. The essayist makes boarding school his focus, using it to explain and describe how and why he has changed over the years. A lot of students write about what wonderful people they have become, but they fail to do a good job of understanding and explaining the forces that prevailed to make them change. This writer focuses on the strengths of the school itself. He demonstrates the sort of values it tries to instill in its students such as, " Encouraging us to collaborate with each other and make use of all resources that we may find, " and " Giving respect to everyone and everything." Because the writer does so, the reader never doubts that the applicant possesses all the qualities that he credits to the school. Using this method has two advantages. First, the positive, upbeat attitude he has toward his institution is rare. Second, Stanford, for one, recognized that this would reflect well on his ability to adapt to and be a positive force at their school.</p>

<p><strong>Wellesley Application Essay</strong></p>
<p>It took me eighteen years to realize what an extraordinary influence my mother has been on my life. She' s the kind of person who has thoughtful discussions about which artist she would most want to have her portrait painted by (Sargent), the kind of mother who always has time for her four children, and the kind of community leader who has a seat on the board of every major project to assist Washington' s impoverished citizens. Growing up with such a strong role model, I developed many of her enthusiasms. I not only came to love the excitement of learning simply for the sake of knowing something new, but I also came to understand the idea of giving back to the community in exchange for a new sense of life, love, and spirit.</p>

<p>My mother' s enthusiasm for learning is most apparent in travel. I was nine years old when my family visited Greece. Every night for three weeks before the trip, my older brother Peter and I sat with my mother on her bed reading Greek myths and taking notes on the Greek Gods. Despite the fact that we were traveling with fourteen-month-old twins, we managed to be at each ruin when the site opened at sunrise. I vividly remember standing in an empty ampitheatre pretending to be an ancient tragedian, picking out my favorite sculpture in the Acropolis museum, and inserting our family into modified tales of the battle at Troy. Eight years and half a dozen passport stamps later I have come to value what I have learned on these journeys about global history, politics and culture, as well as my family and myself.</p>

<p>While I treasure the various worlds my mother has opened to me abroad, my life has been equally transformed by what she has shown me just two miles from my house. As a ten year old, I often accompanied my mother to (name deleted), a local soup kitchen and children' s center. While she attended meetings, I helped with the Summer Program by chasing children around the building and performing magic tricks. Having finally perfected the " floating paintbrush" trick, I began work as a full time volunteer with the five and six year old children last June. It is here that I met Jane Doe, an exceptionally strong girl with a vigor that is contagious. At the end of the summer, I decided to continue my work at (name deleted) as Jane' s tutor. Although the position is often difficult, the personal rewards are beyond articulation. In the seven years since I first walked through the doors of (name deleted), I have learned not only the idea of giving to others, but also of deriving from them a sense of spirit.</p>

<p>Everything that my mother has ever done has been overshadowed by the thought behind it. While the raw experiences I have had at home and abroad have been spectacular, I have learned to truly value them by watching my mother. She has enriched my life with her passion for learning, and changed it with her devotion to humanity. In her endless love of everything and everyone she is touched by, I have seen a hope and life that is truly exceptional. Next year, I will find a new home miles away. However, my mother will always be by my side.</p>

<p><em>** ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE COMMENTS **</em></p>
<p>The topic of this essay is the writer's mother. However, the writer definitely focuses on herself, which makes this essay so strong. She manages to impress the reader with her travel experience, volunteer and community experience, and commitment to learning without ever sounding boastful or full of herself. The essay is also very well organized.</p>

<p><strong>Harvard Application</strong></p>
<p>Of all the characters that I've "met" through books and movies, two stand out as people that I most want to emulate. They are Attacus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird and Dr. Archibald "Moonlight" Graham from Field of Dreams. They appeal to me because they embody what I strive to be. They are influential people in small towns who have a direct positive effect on those around them. I, too, plan to live in a small town after graduating from college, and that positive effect is something I must give in order to be satisfied with my life.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham are strong supporting characters in wonderful stories. They symbolize good, honesty, and wisdom. When the story of my town is written I want to symbolize those things. The base has been formed for me to live a productive, helpful life. As an Eagle Scout I represent those things that Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham represent. In the child/adolescent world I am Mr. Finch and Dr. Graham, but soon I'll be entering the adult world, a world in which I'm not yet prepared to lead.</p>

<p>I'm quite sure that as teenagers Attacus Finch and Moonlight Graham often wondered what they could do to help others. They probably emulated someone who they had seen live a successful life. They saw someone like my grandfather, 40-year president of our hometown bank, enjoy a lifetime of leading, sharing, and giving. I have seen him spend his Christmas Eves taking gifts of food and joy to indigent families. Often when his bank could not justify a loan to someone in need, my grandfather made the loan from his own pocket. He is a real-life Moonlight Graham, a man who has shown me that characters like Dr. Graham and Mr. Finch do much much more than elicit tears and smiles from readers and movie watchers. Through him and others in my family I feel I have acquired the values and the burning desire to benefit others that will form the foundation for a great life. I also feel that that foundation is not enough. I do not yet have the sophistication, knowledge, and wisdom necessary to succeed as I want to in the adult world. I feel that Harvard, above all others, can guide me toward the life of greatness that will make me the Attacus Finch of my town.</p>

<p><em>** ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE COMMENTS **</em></p>
<p>This essay is a great example of how to answer this question well. This applicant chose characters who demonstrated specific traits that reflect on his own personality. We believe that he is sincere about his choices because his reasons are personal (being from a small town, and so forth). He managed to tell us a good deal about himself, his values, and his goals while maintaining a strong focus throughout.</p>

<p><strong>Georgetown Application</strong></p>
<p>For many years, I have been interested in studying international relations. My interest in pursuing this field stems from several factors which have affected me. First, I have been exposed to international affairs throughout my life. With my father and two of my brothers in the Saudi Foreign Service, I have grown up under the shadow of inter-national affairs. Second, I am fascinated by history, economics, and diplomacy. I believe, through the study of international relations, I can effectively satisfy my curiosity in these fields. A third factor which has affected my interest in international relations is patriotism.</p>

<p>Through the Foreign Service, I would not only have the opportunity to serve my country, but also have the chance to help bridge gaps between my country and others. Finally, as a Saudi living abroad, I have been bridging cultures throughout my life. This experience has taught me to look for differences to compromise and similarities to synthesize in order to balance different cultures. In short, I believe that my experiences in life, combined with a rigorous academic education, will enable me to pursue a successful career in the Saudi Foreign Service.</p>

<p><strong>Georgetown, Favorite Class</strong></p>
<p>At St. Albans, especially in our later years, we are given the freedom to choose from a vast array of classes. Using this freedom, I have selected classes which have personal significance to me, regardless of difficulty or appearance on my transcript. However, from these classes, one holds an extraordinary amount of value to me. This course is A.P. Omnibus History, a combination of American and European history. There are several reasons for my great interest in this class. First, I am fascinated by the cyclical nature of the past. I see these recurring political, economic, and social trends as a means of looking forward into the future, while allowing us to avoid the mistakes of the past. Second, history teaches many lessons about the nature of human behavior, both past and present, providing insight into the actions, desires, and aspirations of those around me. Finally, it lays a solid foundation for several disciplines, including political science, economics, and international relations, three fields of great interest to me.</p>

<p><strong>Georgetown, Visual Arts</strong></p>
<p>Another major interest of mine, which I have not had the opportunity to express elsewhere on my application, is the visual arts. Throughout high school, I have used a variety of media to express myself. I began with black and white photography, focusing on the presence of lines and balance in nature. For my work in this medium, I received an award at the St. Albans School Art Show. From photography, I moved on to glass etching. Using a sandblaster to etch the glass, I again concen-trated on lines and balance in my works. Moreover, by arranging several glass panes into a sculpture, I moved my study into three dimensions, winning another Art Show award. Currently, I am working on canvas, using oil and acrylic in a Mondrian style, which is based on lines and balance. Eventually, I hope to explore the effects of combining these and other media, creating my own style of artistic expression.</p>

<p><strong>Georgetown, Wrestling</strong></p>
<p>In the past four years of my life, no activity has affected me more than wrestling. Four years of varsity wrestling and the honor of being a team captain has instilled many qualities in me. First, through years of hard work and continuous dieting, wrestling has given me discipline. This discipline has spread to other parts of my personality, including my moral character, work ethic, and preserverence. Another quality wrestling has given me is leadership. As a team captain, I have learned to lead by example, both on and off the mat. Above all, though, wrestling has given me a love of life. Through this sport, I have experienced pain, sacrifice, adversity, and success. Exposure to these feelings- which are, in my opinion, the essence of being- has allowed me to truly appreciate life. I hope to continue wrestling at Georgetown. </p>

<p><em>** ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE COMMENTS **</em></p>
<p>What immediately strikes the reader about this set- before even reading it- is the balance between the essays. Each answer contains only one paragraph, each of approximately equal length. The solid structure of each essay and the focus of each reflects this outward balance. Each one focuses on a completely different area of its writer's life, another striking detail. The first focuses on his career goals, the second on his interest in history, the third on his interest in the visual arts, and the fourth on wrestling. This is a perfect example of the jigsaw puzzle approach. When put together, you have a well-rounded individual with passion, depth, and involvement in many different areas.</p>

<p><strong>Princeton Application</strong></p>
<p>A creek is no place for shoes. I think it's unreasonable to ask children to keep their shoes on in such a place. My bare feet were always covered with calluses from walking down the rough pavement of Peardale Street and around the corner, past the weeping willows, but not as far as the Lindsay's squeaky old swing-set. It was hard to see from the road, and as far as I could tell, nobody ever went there- except for me. Large pines nearby stood tall and erect, looking down at the ripples and currents that nudged each other about playfully, like children in the back seat of a car on a long drive. Stones and pebbles lined the shallow bottom and allowed the water to glide in creative patterns over their smooth surfaces. Larger, moss covered rocks dotted the bank and provided ideal spots for a child to sit and watch and wonder.</p>

<p>The creek often taught me things; it was my mentor. Once I discovered tadpoles in several of the many eddies and stagnant pools that lined the small rivulet. A cupped hand and a cleaned-out mayonnaise jar aided me in clumsily scooping up some of the more slothful individuals. With muddy hands and knees, I set them on the kitchen counter, and watched them daily as they developed into tiny frogs. I was fascinated by what was taking place before my eyes, but new questions constantly puzzled me. Dad was usually responsible for assuaging these curiosities. He told me about different kinds of metamorphosis and how other little tiny creatures lived in the water that I couldn't see without a fancy magnifying glass.</p>

<p>By the creek, my mind was free to wander. I remember sitting silently on a mossy rock and watching the birds; I used to pretend I was one. As my body lay still, my imagination would take flight. High above, looking down on this stream from the pale blue heavens, the wind whistled over my face and the sun warmed my body. When my eyes flickered open, it was usually time to go home. Sometimes I even did.</p>

<p>I was always up for a challenge. My sister and I used to jump from rock to rock, in a kind of improvised hop-scotch obstacle course that tested our balance and agility against one another. She was four years older and I had to practice every morning when she was at school in order to keep up. On the rare occasions that I outdid her, I wore a goofy smirk for the rest of the day.
The creek was a frontier. The stream extended far into the depths of the woods. I thought that if I wandered too far into its darkness, I might be consumed by it and never heard from again. Gradually overcoming my fear, I embarked on expeditions and drafted extensive maps using my father' s old compass, a sheet of paper, and a few colored pencils. As my body grew in height and weight, my boundaries grew in extent and breadth.
Years later, I happened to be walking to a friend' s house by way of the creek. It occurred to me that what was once an expedition was now merely a shortcut. Although I had left this stream behind, I found others: new questions and freedoms, new challenges and places to explore. But this creek would remain foremost in my memory, whatever stream, river, or ocean I might wade.</p>

<p><strong>Princeton, Athlete (football)</strong></p>
<p>I have learned a great many things from participating in varsity football. It has changed my entire outlook on and attitude toward life. Before my freshman year at [high-school], I was shy, had low self-esteem and turned away from seemingly impossible challenges. Football has altered all of these qualities. On the first day of freshman practice, the team warmed up with a game of touch football. The players were split up and the game began. However, during the game, I noticed that I didn't run as hard as I could, nor did I try to evade my defender and get open. The fact of the matter is that I really did not want to be thrown the ball. I didn't want to be the one at fault if I dropped the ball and the play didn't succeed. I did not want the responsibility of helping the team because I was too afraid of making a mistake. That aspect of my character led the first years of my high school life. I refrained from asking questions in class, afraid they might be considered too stupid or dumb by my classmates. All the while, I went to practice and everyday, I went home physically and mentally exhausted.</p>

<p>Yet my apprehension prevailed as I continued to fear getting put in the game in case another player was injured. I was still afraid of making mistakes and getting blamed by screaming coaches and angry teammates. Sometimes these fears came true. During my sophomore season, my position at backup guard led me to play in the varsity games on many occasions. On such occasions, I often made mistakes. Most of the time the mistakes were not significant; they rarely changed the outcome of a play. Yet I received a thorough verbal lashing at practice for the mistakes I had made. These occurrences only compounded my fears of playing. However, I did not always make mistakes. Sometimes I made great plays, for which I was congratulated. Now, as I dawn on my senior year of football and am faced with two starting positions, I feel like a changed person.</p>

<p>Over the years, playing football has taught me what it takes to succeed. From months of tough practices, I have gained a hard work ethic. From my coaches and fellow teammates, I have learned to work well with others in a group, as it is necessary to cooperate with teammates on the playing field. But most important, I have also gained self-confidence. If I fail, it doesn't matter if they mock or ridicule me; I'll just try again and do it better. I realize that it is necessary to risk failure in order to gain success. The coaches have always said before games that nothing is impossible; I know that now. Now, I welcome the challenge. Whether I succeed or fail is irrelevant; it is only important that I have tried and tested myself.</p>

<p><em>** ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE COMMENTS **</em></p>
<p>The topic of this essay is how the applicant has matured and changed since his freshman year. He focuses on football. One of the strengths of this essay is that it is well organized. The applicant clearly put time into the structure and planning of this essay. He uses the platform of football to discuss and demonstrate his personal growth and development through the high school years. What he could have done better was spend more time describing himself after he made improvements. As it is, he only tells us about his newfound confidence and drive. This essay would have been stronger had he actually shown us, perhaps by including a story or describing an event where his confidence made a difference.</p>

Each essay you read should make you feel like you've just met an interesting person that you'd like to hear more about, or meet, or in the case of the admissions committee, accept.</p>

<p><strong>While the World Sleeps</strong></p>
<p>When I wake up to the ear-splitting sound of my alarm clock, and blindly search for the snooze button, a sudden thought dawns: "What am I doing?"</p>

<p>The time is 5:30 AM; all is dark and hushed. My weary body feels completely drained of energy. While straining to open my eyes, still warm and snug in my comfortable bed, I am overcome with a feeling of lethargy. "Perhaps I should call in sick." Despite all my musing, and my bed's magnetic pull, I still manage to rise each morning at this ungodly hour to join the cross-country running team in rigorous training.</p>

<p>Cross-country running, a sport that requires the fusing of body and mind, strives to maximize your physical ability by testing your mental tenacity. Everyday represents a new struggle to beat yesterday's maximum output, an issue of mind over matter. I have known the agony of this conflict since I joined the newly established cross-country team. As convincing as my morning doubts are, I do not heed them. Through pains and sprains and through adverse weather and unfavorable conditions, I run because I made up my mind three years ago to succeed. </p>

<p>With amenities such as cars and buses, I have no pragmatic reason to use my feet, especially if I lack a destination. I do not run to the gym to acquire a stylish figure, for my slender frame does not require it. And this grueling run differs from a relaxing jog to a coffee shop. I am pushing myself constantly to run faster and farther, for my team as well as for personal glory. Somehow with tireless effort and unflagging commitment, I run through the sleeping streets of my neighborhood with the awareness that I am steadily reaching my goal-maintaining the discipline that cross-country demands. In my mind I see a victory line that symbolizes the results of perseverance and hard work. This line makes me realize that ambition and tenacity do not go in vain. And it constantly reminds me that all those mornings in which I struggled to leave my cozy cocoon have allowed me to fly. 
While the world slept, I, Jane Smith, was awake and working hard to attain my goal. I feel more confident now, that on the road of life, when others may be walking, I will be running. I will run through ankle injuries and through fatigue. I will endure the inevitable hills and valleys. I will endure, and I will achieve. </p>

<p><strong>Discovering Ivy U</strong></p>
<p>Discovering and choosing a university that fulfills all of my needs was a rigorous yet exciting task. The Ivy U clearly emerged as the best choice for me and I, as a great match for the university. After visiting the campus, reading the information pamphlet, and researching the university Web site, I realize that Ivy offers what I hope to gain from my college experience. In return, I will contribute to the university as a person with leadership qualities who takes initiative and enjoys participating in school events. </p>

<p>For many years, I have wanted to become a midwife, and the Ivy School of Nursing stands out as the premium institution for such training. The university's close proximity to many hospitals will familiarize me with patients and hospital life, allowing me the best training possible.</p>

<p>As an individual, I will thrive in the intimate and familiar environment of the nursing school, one of Ivy's smallest schools. Coming from a small high school, I was greatly impressed by my visit to the campus, where I noticed the close relationships between the professors and students, and the strong family feeling within the nursing school. </p>

<p>The location of Ivy's nursing school within the large campus of Ivy's other schools offers myriad benefits. Firstly, I will have the opportunity to take classes in any of the other schools at Ivy, and this seamless academic integration will allow me to pursue my interests outside of nursing.</p>

<p>In addition to academic breadth, there are a greater variety of extra-curricular activities available on the larger campus. I am excited about continuing my interests in sports and theater. I have played on my high school's varsity volleyball team for two years and I plan to play volleyball throughout college in Ivy's women's club volleyball. I also performed in The Sound of Music in high school and the Teatron will allow me to actively participate in theater. </p>

<p>As president of the student council, I have always promoted school spirit, and I intend to continue my enthusiastic involvement throughout my college career. My school places a large emphasis on test grades and homework, creating a serious mood throughout the school. As president, I have tried to enrich the school experience by planning events such as school lunches and interesting field trips. I have learned through my role as president to take charge, delegate responsibilities, be creative, innovative, exciting, and take responsibility. I hope to use these attributes to contribute to many of the clubs and activities offered at Ivy. </p>

<p>At the beginning of this school year, I took the initiative and single-handedly started a need-based tutoring service to pair weaker students with scholastically competent seniors and juniors. Approximately thirty students have been successfully paired and my school has permanently adopted this program. I am thrilled to know that Ivy has a tutoring service to help immigrants and political refugees in West Philadelphia where I can continue tutoring while in college. </p>

<p>I have chosen to apply early decision to the Ivy School of Nursing for I realize that Ivy is the perfect university for me. A college is ultimately as good as the students who attend, and as a well-rounded student who excels academically, socially, and in her extra curricular activities, I feel that I will add to and learn from Ivy and its flourishing environment. I function most effectively in a small academic setting and will derive all the benefits of the university's intimate yet rich campus. I truly believe that I will fulfill my potential by attending the University of Ivy. </p>

<p><strong>Rite of Passage</strong></p>
<p>"Sarah, we need your help in Ukraine this summer. Can I count on you?" This question changed my life profoundly. I was asked to be a counselor on JOLT, Jewish Overseas Leadership Program, an opportunity to interact with young campers in an impoverished country and positively influence their lives. Little did I realize that this experience would impact mine so greatly. </p>

<p>JOLT, an outreach program, runs an annual overnight summer camp in Ukraine with counselors from the United States and Israel. These counselors are carefully selected because of the rigorous programming and the many physical hardships of living in Ukraine. Over one hundred local children come to Charkov to learn about their Jewish background. As one of the counselors, I had the privilege and extraordinary task of exposing them to the beauty of our religion and heritage. </p>

<p>I remember the anxiety and excitement that I felt as I exited the plane with twenty other high school students, embarking on my summer teaching experience, wondering if I was fully prepared. The moment the busloads of children arrived, I attached myself to a group of kids and started singing and dancing with them. Despite my initial fears, we began to form a bond. My role changed from that of a teenager to that of a responsible counselor. Not only was I here to teach them about Judaism through classes and activities, but more importantly I was acting as a role model. For the majority of Ukrainian children, we were the first Americans they had ever met and, therefore, were watched vigilantly and constantly emulated. This humbling realization made me feel rather self-conscious at first. However, their desire to imitate also heightened the impact of that which we taught them. They wanted to learn. Although an immense language barrier lay between the campers and me, we managed to communicate through translators, hand signals, songs, and broken English and Russian. </p>

<p>With the help of a book that contained both the Hebrew and Russian, I taught Hebrew to a group of ten children who had never before been exposed to Judaism. Glieb, a ten-year old boy rapidly rose to the top of the class. In addition to the mandatory hours of daily learning, he was motivated to extend these sessions. So often at night after the fun and entertainment, he and I would practice reading Hebrew and we discussed, in simple terms, aspects of Jewish ritual that fascinated him. It was with Glieb that I formed the deepest bond, one that relied not only on talking, for he spoke only a minimal amount of English, but rather on demonstrating our fondness through actions. </p>

<p>A few days before the end of camp, in broken English, Glieb explained that he had been working endlessly on a present for me. Similarly I had been trying to decide on something that I could give him. After hours of pondering, I decided to give Glieb what was most dear to me, my siddur (prayer book), which I had received upon entering sixth grade. I felt it appropriate to present him with his very first prayer book. For hours I decorated and transliterated the main prayers and on the last day of camp, before the kids left, we exchanged presents. He gave me his favorite key-chain of the "Sylvester" cartoon with an attached lanyard that he had made. Never had a gift had such a startling effect on me; I burst into tears. I handed him my siddur, and he stood there for a moment staring at his gift, and I at mine. Tears welled in his eyes as he continued to look at the siddur. I knew that he truly understood the significance of our exchange. We hugged goodbye, and I will never forget the feeling of his arms entwined around me with the siddur pressed against my back. </p>

<p>Who would have thought that I would go to Ukraine, make such a strong impression on the lives of a group of children and impact my own? The campers' naive yet deep questioning took me on a journey of self-discovery as I reexamined my own beliefs and practices in a foreign environment, spiritually void and materially deprived. This defining experience also taught me that I can make a difference. By continuing to work with people in my professional life as a nurse, I will be extending the passions I discovered during my summer experience. Just as I answered the call for help in Ukraine, I intend to respond to future calls for help — with action, kindness, and caring. </p>

<p><strong>Summer Camp Entrepreneur</strong></p>
<p>The first wedding that I planned was in no way a traditional wedding. Ten eager little girls decorated the printed invitations with sequins, buttons, and markers. The same energetic hands prepared the wedding feast, consisting of bagged lunches, blintz souffle, and of course a layer cake. On the big day I looked around with excitement. Again, I noticed something odd about this wedding. All the participants and guests appeared about four feet high. The "groom" had long hair pinned up with brown lines on her face (was that supposed to be a beard?) The wedding location, a back yard with a swing set and a wading pool, seemed far from romantic. This wedding however was not supposed to be one of those types of weddings. As I pressed the "PLAY" button on the tape recorder I knew that ten 4-6-year-old girls cared deeply about this wedding. Despite the absence of a reason for celebration, I pulled all the girls into the circle and we started dancing and clapping to the music. The energy that went into the preparation on previous days could finally be appreciated. My campers and I not only celebrated the accomplishment of the mock wedding, we celebrated the fun and excitement we experienced for the first three weeks in Camp Glitter Girls. I had begun preparing for Camp Glitter Girls over four months before by budgeting, sending out fliers, confirming registration and finally making sure that every camper would have the time of her life. As I danced, I celebrated the times I almost lost my patience but didn't, the times that I planned activities late into the night because I knew that only an organized schedule would ensure the success of my camp. </p>

<p>The lessons I had learned from previous summer camps contributed greatly to this camp's success. At the age of thirteen, I first ran a camp for eight children. The next year a friend and I co-managed a camp for twenty children at a small school campus. Finally at the age of fifteen I created my most challenging summer camp with thirty-five children. In just three years the size of my camp tripled and so did the life lessons. I not only carried the responsibility for my own "bunk," but with my co-manager I hired other counselors, arranged busing to and from field trips, managed a $15,000 budget, and ensured that thirty-five children had a fun summer. The overnight to San Diego, water fun, cheers, a carnival to end the summer and many other events definitely ensured that my campers had a great summer. However, at the end of those six weeks, new ideas floated in my mind about how I would manage a camp next time. </p>

<p>The camp's increased size added new dimensions to management. On one occasion I firmly reminded a mother of her financial obligations to the camp when she started bargaining. When counselors failed to perform as expected I was required to separate friendships and business. With a much wider variety of campers, I dealt with behavioral problems among the campers. This even included involving the parents in the case of two unusually unruly boys. While a troubled girl with attention deficit disorder in my "bunk" needed special attention, I had to make sure that none of my other campers felt slighted in any way. As the summer progressed I learned how sometimes I just have to put my foot down and say "no." Sometimes extra attention is not always best for a difficult child. Most importantly, I had an experience in the real world of business that taught me how to stand up for myself and address interpersonal and administrative problems. </p>

<p>This past summer as I looked around the yard at the beaming faces flushed from dancing, I realized that Camp Glitter Girls was the culmination of all the experiences and lessons in which I partook since my first camp four years earlier. I learned how to make a camp with ten campers far more fun and even more profitable than a camp for thirty-five children. Instead of marketing to a broad range of ages, I marketed Camp Glitter Girls to a specific age group of girls. The smaller group facilitated a close and familiar atmosphere, not to mention a decrease in problems. Instead of focusing on the quantity of campers, I focused on the quality of my campers' experience, and we all reaped the benefits. The mock wedding at my previous camps never exuded the energy and spirit of the one at Camp Glitter Girls. As the dancing subsided and I heard oohs and aahs over the cake, I looked at every single girl in the room. I did not just see cute adorable faces; rather I saw how each girl challenged me in her own way and unconsciously taught me her own special lesson. </p>

<p>As I turn towards my future and make life-defining decisions, I look back upon my experiences with my campers for inspiration and direction. I view my upcoming years at university as an opportunity to further use the skills I acquired in running summer camps. The diversity, academic excellence, and broad array of classes and extracurricular activities at UCLA will provide an environment that will challenge me to use the leadership, initiative, creativity and interpersonal abilities that I used at Camp Glitter Girls. </p>

<h4>Major College Essay Mistakes</h4>
<p>Writing about the beauty of a campus is a major college essay mistake. Find out why.</p>

<p>One of the major college essay mistakes students too often make is writing about how beautiful a campus is. We know — this sounds silly. Why is this one of the biggest mistakes a student can make in their college essays? It’s a complement, right? The fact is — sure, it’s nice to attend a college that has a beautiful campus. But in your “Why College” essay, writing paragraph after paragraph about how beautiful the campus is will hinder your chances of admission. A beautiful campus should in no way be one of the seminal reasons for why you want to attend a university.</p>

<p>It’s not like you’d ever write that a college isn’t beautiful, just as you wouldn’t tell a date that you’re interested in that he or she isn’t good looking. Stating as much in your college essay is superflous. It’s telling college admissions counselors what you think they want to hear. The fact is, they know they’ve got a beautiful campus. But what they also know is that if you’re spending so much real estate in your “Why College” essay telling them how green their grass is and how perfectly manicured its bushes are, you probably don’t know a whole lot about the university.</p>

<p>This major college essay mistake smells like you don’t know what you’re talking about, that you’re just putting words on the page for the sake of putting words on the page. It smells like you didn’t do research about the university. Instead of writing about the grass, write about classes. Write about professors. Write about how you can pursue your academic interests. Write about your passions and how you intend to further explore them at the university through their various organizations and teams. Write your “Why College” essay as though you actually know what the college is all about. After all, you should have visited the school to which you’re applying! And if you haven’t done that yet, you might want to get on it before you click “submit.”</p>

<h4>College Essay Writing Mistakes</h4>

<p>There are so many college essay writing mistakes that one can make. We’d like to showcase a couple for you to see if you’d even catch them. In the sample excerpt below, there are a few key mistakes that a college applicant makes. Can you spot the errors that can very well cost the applicant a shot in the incoming class? And if you can spot the mistakes, let us know why you think they are mistakes in the first place!</p>

<p>Notice any college essay writing mistakes in the excerpt we've provided? We hope you at least notice a couple of mistakes!</p>

<p>Excerpt: “Habitat for Humanity has immensely shaped my life. Building homes for poor families is an incredible experience, one that I’ll always remember. With so many families across our nation struggling to find jobs and pay their mortgages, it’s great to be part of the effort to create change in America! Having spent time with many of these families over the three years that I’ve worked with Habitat for Humanity and having spent a few hours with many of the families we help, I can understand their plight. I am a better person for this experience.”</p>

<p>Any luck spotting some major mistakes? If not, we’ll help point them out for you. First, the writer should show rather than tell. The writer states that Habitat for Humanity has shaped her life. That’s telling the college admissions counselor what she thinks she wants to hear. Instead of writing that it’s shaped her life, she needs to show in a less overt way how indeed it has shaped her life. Next, referring to the families who she’s helping as “poor families” reads as cold and out of touch with humanity. It paints the applicant as unlikeable and arrogant — something an applicant should absolutely avoid in the highly selective college admissions process!</p>

<p>And she spent a few hours with these families and therefore understands their plight? Seriously? She needs to get off her high horse. Just because she spent a few hours with a family struggling to pay the bills doesn’t mean she understands what it’s like to struggle to put food on the table. Oy vey. Oh and “I am a better person for this experience” — this is trite and college essays should be anything but trite. It’s the trap that too many college applicants fall into. Avoid being trite at all cost. And avoid being arrogant and unlikeable as well! These are major college essay mistakes you need to know about. </p>

<h4>College Essay Redundancies</h4>

<p>In “Up in the Air,” George Clooney’s character eliminated redundant employees. In your college application, eliminate redundancies throughout your college essays!</p>

<p>Too many college applicants submit college essay redundancies in their applications! What does that mean? That means that if you write about playing basketball in your activity essay (which already isn’t a very good idea since sports essays are overdone and typically come across as trite), don’t then write about basketball in your personal statement. Is that all you know? Is that the only side of you? No. Well, maybe…but then you’re not going to get into a highly selective college. Are colleges looking for well rounded applicants? No. They want students who demonstrate talent in specific areas. Maybe it’s as a science researcher or as a tennis player. But that doesn’t mean that you should only shine in one specific area in your college essays. There’s a difference between being an typical, well rounded applicant who doesn’t shine in any one area and having essays that show different sides of who you are.</p>

<p>If you write about science research in your activity essay, consider writing about juggling in your personal statement if indeed you have a passion for juggling. While juggling may sound silly, the best college essays are often about the silliest things that nonetheless show that you’re intellectually curious and interesting. Have you ever seen an episode of “Seinfeld?” We bet you have. What do you think “Seinfeld” is about on a week to week basis? It’s about nothing. Don’t try to write about too much. Often times, writing about something small can showcase you the best to colleges. It can make you come across as different, as someone they have to add to their incoming class.</p>

<p>So, to be utterly redundant but at the same time to drill in the point, don’t write about science research in every one of your college essays. Don’t write about crew in every one of your essays either. Show different sides of yourself. Show interesting sides of yourself. In doing so, you’ll make your college application less redundant and more compelling! Less redundant, more compelling. Less redundant, more compelling…</p>

<h4>College Essay Mistake</h4>

<p>College admissions counselors want students who play well with others. It’s a college essay mistake to imply that you don’t.
One common college essay mistake is for students to write what they think college admissions officers want to hear. Maybe that means tooting your own horn by writing about how smart you are (that’s a major college essay mistake that will more than likely lead to a denial at highly competitive colleges). Maybe it means writing about how you wake up every morning so excited to want to go to school to learn (a love of learning is certainly very important but “show don’t tell” and, also, be credible). But let’s point out one other mistake that students commit all the time.</p>

<p>You want to show that you can play well with others. While former Dartmouth College president James O. Freedman once sought to recruit students who preferred to pass days reading poetry under trees, it’s important for college admissions counselors to know that you get along well with your classmates and enjoy doing activities with them. They want people who are going to change the world and, in order to do so, it’s important to be good with people. While it shows intellectual curiosity to spend days reading under a tree, it’s equally as important to demonstrate that you’re easy to get along with.</p>

<p>College admissions counselors want students who other students will like. They want people who offer diverse opinions and may differ on issues with classmates but that doesn’t mean these same classmates shouldn’t not like them. College admissions is by no means a popularity contest. Highly selective colleges aren’t after the prom king and queen. But they are after intellectually curious students who also happen to be someone they wouldn’t mind spending time with.</p>

<h4>Mistakes in College Essays</h4>

<p>Writing about what you think about while swimming and staring at the black line on the bottom of the pool can be a good idea for a college essay.</p>

<p>Since it’s the season for writing college essays, we thought we’d walk you through some common mistakes in college essays. In fact, we’re going to show you some sample sentences and then explain exactly what’s wrong. Even if the essay reads well and is enjoyable, these kinds of mistakes can mean the difference between being admitted and being denied. And these are just a few!</p>

<p>Sample: “My mother convinced me to get involved in science research and it turned out to be a good decision on her part. I’ve since fallen in love with centrifuges, pipettes, and mice.”</p>

<p><em>Why It’s A Mistake: Your mother shouldn’t have had to convince you to get involved in science research. You should have wanted to get involved in research on your own. You should have this drive, this intellectual curiosity. Colleges want to see that.</em></p>

<p>Sample: “Working for Senator Gillibrand has been an amazing experience. I started off at the bottom of the ladder, getting coffee and running errands. I didn’t really enjoy it much. But after several days, I got to really be a part of the political decision-making.”</p>

<p><em>Why It’s A Mistake: There are a few mistakes in this one: (1) Don’t put down starting at the bottom. That’s often how you work your way up in this life. It comes across like the student thinks they’re too good to get coffee and run errands; (2) The student may frustrate admissions counselors by writing how she moved up the totem pole after “several days.” Really?! Several days? Boo hoo that she had to get coffee for a whole week; and (3) It’s implausible that a high school student would have a real say in policy decisions in the U.S. Senate. Don’t overstate your role.</em></p>

<p>Sample: “Winning the 400 meter individual medley at state championships was the culmination of all of my hard work and dedication.”</p>

<p><em>Why It’s A Mistake: This is trite. The student worked hard and then won. Think about how many college essays focus on this theme. College admissions counselors are not inspired by students who work hard to win a race. It’s ordinary. Sometimes, sports is the only topic that a student has to write about in an activity essay. If that’s the case (and that’s not good), try to at least spin it in your own way. For instance, if you’re a swimmer, write about what it’s like to stare at a black line on the bottom of the pool for just about every minute of every practice. Write about what you think about during mundane laps.
We’ll be focusing on other mistakes in college essays in coming blog posts.</em></p>

<h4>College Admission Essays</h4>

<p><strong>Sports is a fertile ground for trite college admissions essays (photo credit: Rick Dikeman).</strong></p>
<p>Continuing our series on college admission essays, let’s take a look at another common mistake many high school students make in their personal statement for the Common Application. In this particular college admission essay, the topic happens to be sports.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s the paragraph:</strong></p>

<p>“Soccer has been my passion ever since I was a little kid. I grew up with a soccer ball in my bed. Soccer has in many ways been my outlet, my escape from the stresses of school. Soccer has taught me so many wonderful, powerful lessons like never giving up and always believing in myself. I recall a time when I missed in a shootout. I had let my team down. I was so upset. And yet I picked myself back up and practiced my shot for the next three weeks. The next time I had to participate in an OT shootout, I didn’t miss.”</p>

<p><em>Analysis:</em></p>

<p>This is trite, trite, trite. So many college applicants write about sports and the lessons that can be learned from sports. Picking yourself back up and always believing in yourself are cliché lessons that will put university admissions counselors to sleep faster than NyQuil and chamomile tea! And be careful of starting off every sentence with a word like “soccer.” Many students also begin every sentence with the word “I.” It’s not good to be repetitious like that unless you are doing it for a powerful effect…and that’s rarely the case in college admission essays. Besides, beginning with “I” all the time can make you sound egotistical and that is only going to hurt your chances for college admission. Lastly, show don’t tell. Don’t tell us how soccer has taught you so many powerful lessons. Tell college admissions counselors a narrative. This is your chance to tell your story.</p>

<p><strong>College Application Essays</strong></p>
<p>Avoid writing about trips at all costs on your college application essays (photo credit: Evan Bench).</p>
<p>Continuing our series on common mistakes college applicants often make on their college application essays, let’s take a look at a sample paragraph we’ve written below that is emblematic of a type of essay college admissions counselors often receive. After the sample paragraph, we’ll analyze the writing and give you our insights on why it works…or why it doesn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s the paragraph:</strong></p>

<p>“My trip to South Africa was a remarkable experience. I got to explore Soweto, a place Nelson Mandela once called home. To see children living in poverty without access to a good education was truly unsettling. After Soweto, it was off to Cape Town where I got to climb Table Mountain and see the most beautiful of ocean views. Before I returned home, I had the opportunity to go on Safari at Kruger National Park. The chance to see lions, elephants, zebras, and cheetahs was one I will not soon forget.”</p>

<p><em>Analysis:</em></p>
<p>So many applicants write about trips abroad on their college application essays. There are few things that university admissions counselors find more boring than reading a college essay about the litany of activities a high school student experiences on trips in exotic locales. What does this type of paragraph actually say about a college applicant other than her parents could afford to send her on a trip to another continent? This essay is by no means going to increase her chances for admission to highly competitive universities. University admissions counselors wish they could go on safari at Kruger National Park but instead they’re stuck reading application essays, and so an envious college admissions counselor is not likely to want to admit this student.</p>

<p>What else does this college essay say about the applicant other than she wrote about poverty-stricken Soweto and how the children there don’t have access to a good education? And then the applicant moves on to hiking up beautiful Table Mountain. If anything, this essay demonstrates that the writer is superficial as well as apathetic to the world’s problems. This is not the type of student that admissions officers are seeking. Instead, they want to admit students who care about making the world a better place, students who want to personally tackle the world’s problems and make them their own.</p>

<h4>College Essay Mistakes</h4>
<p>As expressed in an article of “The Daily Beast,” don’t use profanities in your college essays. It’s a major mistake.</p>

<p>There is a funny article in “The Daily Beast” by Kristina Dell that shares the anecdotes of college admissions counselors from this year’s record batch of applications. Many of the anecdotes revolve around silly or even comical things students do during the course of the college admissions process. The majority of these anecdotes are drawn from ridiculous mistakes college applicants make in their college essays. Let’s take a look at some of them.</p>

<p>Said Jim Miller, Dean of Admissions at Brown University, “There was a really strong candidate we didn’t admit because he used an enormous amount of profanity in his personal essay. He had a string of F-bombs that was pretty remarkable. I am not opposed to profanity and sometimes it can work. But, every third word doesn’t work. Otherwise, he would have gotten in.” If cursing didn’t take the cake, another Ivy League admissions counselor said this about an essay: “We had one great line. A young woman wrote that she took a summer course and she meant to say in ‘organismic biology’ but she wrote ‘orgasmic biology’ and went on to say it was the best course she’d ever taken. We didn’t reject her for that outright, but it makes you look twice.”</p>

<p>As we discuss so often with our students, it’s essential to select teachers who will write excellent letters of recommendation for you. It’s important to know how these teachers feel about you as a student and as a person. It’s also important to know that they are capable of writing great letters of recommendation — and that’s something a student’s guidance counselor will often know in advance from their past experiences with letters of recommendation from that teacher. Said an Ivy League admissions counselor, “Pick teachers who know you. Sometimes teachers will damn you with faint praise. One teacher wrote about a student: ‘He is not just an athlete. There is so much less here than meets the eye.’ Another teacher wrote about a different student: ‘Over time, he has developed a set of friends who have learned to tolerate and even accept him.’ Both of these students didn’t get in.”</p>

<p>And yet sometimes, students can write such powerful, moving essays that they inspire college admissions counselors to contact the applicants. For instance, Richard Nesbitt of Williams College describes one student’s essay: “One applicant talked about how she loves to bake bread. The person who was reading her essay happened to have focaccia bread baking in the oven at the time of reading the application. The reader was on the same wavelength and even emailed the student to say, ‘I really liked your essay and here’s my recipe for focaccia bread.’ It’s a funny coincidence, but even the second reader who wasn’t a bread baker was similarly impressed by the application.” Timing sometimes matters!</p>

<p>But let’s get back to the mistakes! Aside from mistakes on the essays, college admissions counselors discuss in “The Daily Beast” how one student sent pies, claiming she wasn’t a good athlete but she was a good baker. The admissions counselors thought the pies were quite tasty but this did not lead to an acceptance. Another student sent a life-size blowup of herself attached to balloons. It was supposed to fly…but alas the balloons didn’t work. And yet another student staged a sit-in in an admissions office lobby, refusing to leave until she was able to speak to a few admissions people. Needless to say, this tactic proved as uneffective as the pies and the blow-up person attached to balloons.</p>

<h4>Plagiarized College Essays</h4>

<p>Don’t ever plagiarize as Joe Biden has done. Plagiarized college essays can lead to big time trouble for you.</p>

<p>What do Vice President Joe Biden, poet T. S. Eliot, and historian Stephen Ambrose all have in common? They have all at some point been accused of plagiarism. While Eliot’s plagiarism would be discovered posthumously, both Biden and Ambrose would live to regret their lapses in judgment.
The consequences of plagiarism on a college essay can reverberate for a lifetime. It can very well result in one’s admission being rescinded, or once a student is matriculated it can result in expulsion; degrees can even be revoked. And then there’s the embarrassment it would bring to not only the student, but also to his/her family, school, and community.</p>

<p>It it okay to get help on a college essay? You bet! To not brainstorm essay topics with someone well versed in the field of selective college admissions, to not have someone review and critique those very essays can put an applicant at a disadvantage. Novelists don’t publish books without their editor, their editor’s assistant, and a team of readers first offering creative insight and proofing. In television, with a few notable exceptions like Marc Cherry’s “Desperate Housewives,” pilot scripts are rarely bought as completed products. Rather, they are purchased as ideas and, together with creative notes from studio and network executives, that pitch is shaped into a story arena, an outline, and, alas, a script that can be produced as a pilot episode.</p>

<p>In an article published recently in “The Dartmouth,” America’s oldest college newspaper, the topic of plagiarism on college applications and a new tool to combat it are addressed. The tool is dubbed “Turnitin for Admissions” and it uses “pattern-matching technology” to identify plagiarized material in college essays. While the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Dartmouth, Maria Laskaris, voices skepticism towards the tool and doesn’t like the idea that it assumes applicants are dishonest from the start, this is nonetheless technology that may soon be used by the Common Application review system.</p>

<p>Laskaris’ reluctance to use the technology is admirable. She believes in the integrity of the applicants to Dartmouth. Her staff of admissions officers is trained to detect plagiarism. And yet Laskaris, like Tom Cruise in “The Last Samurai” is seemingly fighting the future. The fact is that this kind of technology will save time. It will be able to detect plagiarism that may go unnoticed by the human eye, even a well trained eye.</p>

<p>Some students are fearful that this technology has a tendency to pick up strings of words that may not have in fact been plagiarized. But as long as admissions officers then review the batch of applications suspected of plagiarism, there should be no reason to fear if you are not guilty of lifting words, sentences, paragraphs, or entire essays!</p>

<p>In The D article, a student, Ahmad Nazeri ’11, says, “I feel like it’s a waste of resources to put 20,000 applications through a system and spend thousands of dollars on the process and a lot of energy and time.” Mr. Nazeri couldn’t be more wrong as computers take less time than humans to detect plagiarism. For a service fee, a college will invariably save money using this technology.</p>

<p>What if administrators at a college discover that an essay that was written by an admitted applicant two years ago was plagiarized? This could be cause for expulsion. When that happens, the college’s retention rate, a key factor in the US News and World Report rankings, will be adversely affected, and so may its endowment. Mr. Nazeri, there is so much more money that could be lost (not to mention the college’s reputation if it graduates plagiarists).</p>

<p>This isn’t just true in college admissions. It’s true in baseball, in medicine, and in finance. Computer programs that algorithmically discover findings and patterns in data have transformed industries. Ms. Laskaris’ intentions are honorable, but she is on the wrong side of history</p>

<p><strong>What</strong></p>

<p>This section keeps track of the essays you need to write to apply to college. You will write one main essay to apply to college, and you will send this essay to most of your colleges. Additionally you will send your resume to any colleges who allow you to upload it in their supplement pages. In the supplement pages for each college, many colleges also require that you write about 150-200 words on your most meaningful extracurricular activity. Many schools ask that you tell them why you chose to apply to their school, so it is a good idea to have this piece ready as well. Since colleges also ask for their own small (or not so small) supplemental questions, you can keep track of all essays you need to write here. Recycle wherever you can, but always proofread to change the names!</p>

<p><strong>When</strong></p>
<p>Start writing these essays during the second semester of Junior year, lightly. Hit it hard in the summer before Senior year and try to have as many of them as possible finalized before Senior year starts. Plan to edit each piece 5-10 times. Get outside editing help; no one can be their own editor!</p>

<h4>Letters of Recommendation</h4>
<p><strong>Teacher Recommendations (Teacher Report)</strong></p>
 
<p>Most schools require one or two letters of recommendation from academic teachers. Ideally, you should ask teachers from eleventh grade (they have witnessed your growth throughout an entire year) who have taught you in two different academic subjects. Senior year teachers may be used in some cases. The best recommendations are not always those from whom you earned the highest grades. The most compelling recommendations could come from a teacher in whose class you struggled at the outset and ultimately conquered in the end. A teacher recommender should know you well as an academic—schools aim to discern an applicant’s academic character in these letters. Schools look to the college counselor for the big picture, the stuff outside of and related to the classroom.</p>
 
<p>Be sure to discuss with your college counselor who you intend to ask to write your letters of recommendation. This decision—and request—should be made no later than October of your senior year.</p>
 
<p><strong>Follow these guidelines to request teacher recommendations:</strong></p>
 
<p>Request in person. Faculty are not jazzed about writing a recommendation for a student who makes the request via a note on a desk or a quick email. Try to approach your teacher when he/she is not juggling several things at once. Teachers are under no obligation to write for you, therefore your appreciation of their effort is important. Furthermore, if a teacher feels he/she cannot advocate for you he/she will decline your request.</p>
 
<p>If you are applying for a specific academic area, plan your recommendations accordingly. If you are applying to an engineering or an art school, be sure that one of your recommendations speaks directly to that area i.e. math or science for engineering applicants and studio art for art school applicants.</p>
 
<p>Ask the teacher if there is anything he/she needs to write an effective recommendation. The teacher may ask you to provide your extracurricular activities profile, or ask for a statement about your interest in the college or a particular academic area of interest. Be sure you honor their request(s) in a timely manner.</p>
 
<p>Always thank your recommending teachers in writing. Recommendation writing is time consuming. Essentially, their only benefit is your warm, smiling, appreciative face and sincere, heartfelt gratitude. Also, let them know how things work out later in the year and where you end up enrolling. They do care!</p>
 
<p><strong>Counselor Recommendation (Secondary School Report)</strong></p>
 
<p>If you do not know your college counselor well, plan to provide him/her with a copy of your extracurricular activities and a “brag sheet” of your academic and extracurricular achievements. Talk to your counselor about your interest in the colleges on your list.</p>I

<h4>Six Tips For Getting Great Letters of Recommendation For College</h4>

<p>One of the most important elements of your college application is the recommendation of a teacher. College admissions offices take these letters very seriously, and it is critical that you do your best to secure the best letters of recommendation possible.</p>

<p>Some students assume that there is nothing they can do to ensure that the letters are glowing testimonials. While you can’t really expect to sit in the room looking over the shoulder of your teacher as he writes the letter, there are many things you can do to increase the likelihood that the teacher writes a strong letter that will impress admissions officers everywhere.</p>

<p>Here is a step-by-step guide for making sure your letters of recommendation (LORs) are the best they can be.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Get Organized Talk to your guidance counselor or the secretary in the guidance office to find out how the school handles teacher recommendations. At some schools, the guidance office will submit the teacher recommendations from your file to colleges directly, along with your transcripts and the school report. At other schools, teachers are requested to send LORs directly to the colleges. Some schools manage recommendations electronically through software packages like Naviance, while others are using functions on the Common Application. The point is that you must know the procedures at your school before you even get started. And you need to follow those procedures, so as to make the lives of your teachers and counselors as easy as possible. With some teachers writing dozens of letters each year, the more you can make things easy for your teacher writing your letter, your diligence and kindness will reflected in their evaluation of you.</p></li>

	<li><p>Decide Which Teachers Should Write your LORs A good LOR tells a good story about the applicant. The story reflects the strengths—and perhaps a few weaknesses—of the candidate. A good letter contains some details, some examples, some bits of information that bring the candidate to life for the reader. And a good letter might also provide information about the student’s intellectual growth and development over time. Therefore you need to choose a teacher who knows you well to write your letter.</p></li>

	<li><p>You also need to make sure that you choose at least one teacher in a core academic discipline. You are applying to college, not to a resort or a team or to a service club. Admissions officers want to know about your performance in and contributions to the classroom. If you like, you can add a second or third LOR from a band director, a coach, or the head of your youth group. These letters can help round you out as a person. But at least one LOR should be from an English, math, social studies, science, or foreign language teacher.</p>

	<p>Finally, don’t assume that you should choose the teacher in whose class you are performing the best. Nor should it necessarily be the teacher of your favorite subject. As noted earlier, you need to identify the teacher who knows your work, who can tell some good stories, and who can highlight your positive personal qualities.</p></li>

	<li><p>Establish a Relationship with Your Teachers Well before you decide which teacher will write your LOR, you need to consider that a teacher will not know you very well unless you make an effort to get to know the teacher. Participate in class. Ask questions. Work hard. Go above and beyond what is required, to demonstrate your interest, your fortitude, your proficiency. Show up before or after school to ask questions, shoot the breeze, or comment about the course content. Express interest not only in the class, but in the teacher. Obviously, you will get along better with some teachers than with others. So focus your efforts on developing relationships with the teachers with whom you share some connection, some affinity.</p></li>

	<li><p>Consider the Timing of Your Request for an LOR Teachers are busy people. Don’t wait until the last moment to request an LOR. Don’t ask right after your midterm or final exam—when they are still grading stacks of papers. Don’t assume that teachers will write letters during school vacations (you don’t want to work during vacations, and your teachers don’t, either). Look at your own deadlines for your college applications, and consider requesting the LOR at least a couple of months before the deadline. Be considerate and respectful.</p></li>

	<li><p>Pop the Question When you meet with your teacher to request an LOR, you will likely be nervous. Try not to worry. Teachers field these requests all the time, and they expect to be asked. Consider making your request after school or during a teacher’s off period. Don’t make the request via email or over the telephone. Do it in person: it makes a better impression. Your question can go something likes this: “Ms. Baker, out of all my high school classes, I have enjoyed yours the most. I feel that I’ve learned a lot from you. I like the material we are learning, and I think you’re a great teacher. I also think you bring out the best in me. I would like to ask whether you would be willing to write a strong letter of recommendation for me as I apply to colleges this year. Of all my teachers, I think you know me best, and I’d be pleased if you would write my recommendation.” You want to be complimentary of the teacher, but you also want to convey a sense of pride in the work you have done in the class. Brown-nosing won’t work. But if you have built a good relationship with this teacher, he or she will be delighted to give you an enthusiastic “yes,” if you craft your request in this way.</p></li>

	<li><p>Provide Your Teacher With Adequate Information After your teacher answers an enthusiastic “yes!” to your request, you should present him with a slim folder with everything the teacher needs to fulfill your request. The folder will contain a variety of documents (see below) that will help him in writing a detailed letter filled with anecdotes about your skills and abilities. Presenting this folder immediately will convey how seriously you take the teacher—and the recommendation.</p>

	<p> The folder should contain:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your resume</li>
		<li>Your personal statement, assuming you have completed it</li>
		<li>A short “statement of purpose” that outlines the sort of college you hope to attend and why you think that sort of college would be best for you. Write one or two solid paragraphs. Make sure to focus on the academic issues related to your college choice, so that the teacher can provide specific information to support your application.</li>
		<li>A full list of the colleges to which you are applying, including addresses, with application deadlines clearly stated. If you are applying to particular departments, scholarships, or other special programs, makes sure to clarify that information for the teacher.</li>
		<li>The recommendation form or forms the teacher will need to complete (note this might be the form your high school uses, or it could be the form from the Common Application, or you might include the form from each individual college to which you are applying).</li>
		<li>If the letter is to be turned in to the school guidance office, include an envelope in which the completed letter can be sent to the guidance office.</li>
		<li>If the teacher has to send the letter directly to the college, include stamped, addressed envelopes for each college to which you are applying (make sure to clip these to the appropriate blank forms, to make it easy for the teacher to do the collating).</li>
		<li>Your contact information, including phone number, home address, and email address, in case the writer has any questions.</li>
		<li>A short note of personal thanks to express your appreciation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></p>

<p><em>How many recommendations do I need? </em></p>
<p>
As in so many things in life, the priority here is on quality, not quantity. Generally most colleges want one counselor recommendation and one teacher recommendation. I advise my students to obtain two solid recommendations from teachers. One should be from a teacher in a core subject (math, English, science, social studies, or foreign language). The second can be from another core teacher, or from an elective teacher who knows you well or in an area that the student hopes to pursue in college (a budding actor needs a letter from the drama teacher, for example). In some cases, a third letter from a coach, a youth group leader, or some other adult who plays a significant role in the student’s life may be included. Admissions officers spend a total of about seven minutes reviewing an applicant’s file. A pile of letters that say essentially the same thing will be more of a hindrance than a help.</p>

<p><strong>My Dad knows Senator Longbottom from my state. Should I get him to write me a recommendation? </strong></p>

<p>Not unless Senator Longbottom knows you really well and can say something new, different, or eye-opening for the admissions committee that is not otherwise in your application. Gratuitous letters from bigwigs will not impress anyone. The admissions officers want to know first and foremost about your life in the classroom. Senator Longbottom is unlikely to have much to add on that score (unless he was your civics teacher before got himself elected!). Can I request a recommendation letter via email? No. Many high schools now have automated systems for requesting letters of recommendation. These are fine for processing and for making the lives of teachers and counselors easier. If your school uses such a system, you need to adapt your request to accommodate an electronic delivery system. But you should NOT request the recommendation this way. Make your request in person, then follow it up with the electronic request. A face-to-face request shows maturity and respect. An emailed request is wimpy.</p>

<p><strong>What if my teacher turns down my request? </strong></p>

<p>It happens very occasionally. Usually this happens only when a student does not carefully consider whom to ask in the first place. Reasons for rejection vary. Some teachers are too busy. Some teachers will not write letters for students they don’t know well. And some teachers are brutally honest: they will not write a letter unless they can write a strong, supportive one. You have little choice to respect the teacher’s decision and seek one from another. Don’t despair, however; a teacher who turns you down would be unlikely to have written a good recommendation, anyway. Better to opt for your second choice than to get a letter that is weak or (worse) negative.</p>

<p><strong>Should I waive my right to see a letter of recommendation?</strong></p> 
<p>Should it be strictly confidential? A confidential letter is best. Some teachers will provide you with a copy, anyway. But it is better for the admissions officer to believe that the teacher is not sharing his or her comments with you directly. The teacher, too, should feel comfortable about being honest in the recommendation. Often the strongest letters are actually ones that include a couple of insights into the student’s relative weaknesses; these insights can help highlight a teacher’s strengths (plus, a letter that goes on and on with nothing but superlatives really doesn’t say much of anything). If you have chosen your recommender carefully, you need not fret that the letter will say something bad about you. So waive your right to see it, and give that letter an extra measure of weight in the eyes of the admissions officer who reads it.</p>

<p><strong>How can I build a better relationship with my teachers before I ask them for a recommendation? </strong></p>
<p>Thought it may seem somewhat surprising, teachers are human. They like it when students show an interest in them, and in what they are teaching. So engage with your teacher as a human, and as an instructor. Ask questions in class. Come after school or before school with a question (even if you know the answer—sometimes it helps just to get the teacher talking!). Express your thanks. On a day when you feel class was particularly good or the teacher was in fine form, tell her so. If you enjoyed a particular project or assignment, say so as you hand it in (don’t wait to complain about the grade after it is returned). You want to be an eager, conscientious student. But you don’t to be a tiresome brownnoser. If you find that you are forcing yourself to like the teacher or the subject matter, consider asking a different teacher to write your recommendation. Not only are teachers human, they are also able to smell a sycophantic toady a mile away.</p>

<p><strong>How can I thank the writers of my recommendations? </strong></p>
<p>As a former teacher, I’m tempted to say that you should buy them expensive gifts: Rolex watches come to mind. But the best form of gratitude is to act grateful. Write a thank you note (not an email—a handwritten note on a nice card) after you have confirmed that the colleges have received their letters. Make sure to let your recommenders know where you are accepted: run by their office between classes and share your good news, and say thanks for the recommendation. Write another nice note at the end of the year, just before graduation, to let them know how much you appreciate their help in getting you through high school and into college. And, if you really want to make a teacher’s day, week, month, or year, send him a note or two from college. Let them know how you’re doing. Share some good news. Relate what you are learning in college to something you learned in their classroom. Nothing warms a jaded teacher’s heart like a genuine note of thanks from a former student.</p>

<h4>Interviews</h4>
 
<p>Some colleges recommend interviews; very few actually require them, and some do not even offer them. Interviews, when offered, can and do make a difference. The interview is the only official face‐to-face part of the process. However, it is unlikely that the interview by itself will persuade the committee to overlook weaknesses in your application.</p>
 
<h4>Types of Interviews</h4>
 
<p><strong>The on‐campus one‐on‐one interview with an admissions officer or student intern.</strong> Typically, an admissions officer conducts such interviews, and his or her reactions to your 30‐60 minute conversation will be included in your file.</p>
 
<p><strong>The on‐campus group interview.</strong> This type of interview is more useful to students in helping them gain information about the school, than it is in helping the school gain information about the students.</p>
 
<p><strong>The alumni interview.</strong> This type of interview is becoming more popular. It can, occasionally, provide critical information to an admissions committee. Alumni interviews are usually arranged after the college has received your application and take place locally rather than on the college campus.</p>
 
<p><strong>The high school visit or admissions evening (both hosted by a college representative).</strong> Similar to the campus group interview, you can distinguish yourself in the crowd by asking thoughtful questions. Admission officers routinely keep notes of all their contacts with students in these (as well as other) settings.</p>
 
<h4>Objectives in the College Interview<h4/>
 
<p>Your foremost objective is to illustrate to the college representative that you would be a good fit for that school. How do you do that? You can develop your interview objectives based on your strengths and weaknesses, your high school record, and your personality. Consider your responses to the following questions as you prepare for your interview:</p>
 
<ul>
	<li>How do you want the interviewer to remember you?</li>
	<li>How, in 30‐60 minutes, do you communicate the special qualities that set you apart from other applicants?</li>
	<li>How do you handle any doubts the admissions officer may have about a weakness in your record?</li>
	<li>How can you find out if the school is right for you, and how do you want to communicate why you think the college is a good fit for you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that the interviewer has objectives too. His or her primary objective is to learn about you and your interest in their school. However, the interviewer also considers the interview as an opportunity to sell their school to you.</p>
 
<h4>How to Prepare</h4>
 
<p>Do a personal inventory—e.g. what are the five things I’d most like to share with the interviewer.  Think about stories that can be used to answer any number of questions, rather than canned responses that sound rehearsed.</p>
 
<p>Practice answering questions about your record, test scores, grades, course selection, activities, summer experiences, goals, and your interest in this school.</p>
 
<p>Read the literature sent to you by the college, in guidebooks or on the college's website.</p>
 
<p>Come prepared whether or not you have been asked to bring a transcript and be prepared to discuss your academic background and test scores. Also, be prepared to discuss how you spend your time outside of school.</p>
 
<p>Know your objectives and what you hope to accomplish during the interview.</p>
 
<p>Candor and maturity will work in you favor. Be prepared to discuss a blemish in your record without complaining, making excuses, or blaming others.</p>
 
<p>Dress for success! Dress well and neatly. No jeans, t‐shirts, short skirts or revealing clothing. Take your hat off! Make a good first impression.</p>
 
<h4>Interview Do’s</h4>
 
<p>Be yourself.</p>
 
<p>Maintain good eye contact.</p>
 
<p>Dress well and neatly.</p>
 
<p>Be positive, smile!</p>
 
<p>Listen.</p>
 
<p>Try to avoid one sentence or one‐word answers. Remember, each question is an invitation for a conversation. Keep it going.</p>
 
<p>Show interest. Be engaging. Pay attention to both the questions being asked and the answers your interviewer gives.</p>
 
<p>Be honest.</p>
 
<p>Prepare a few questions about the school ahead of time.</p>
 
<p>Relax, have fun! Remember the interviewer is looking for reasons to like you and to find ways in which the college is a good fit for you just as you are trying to sell yourself to the college.</p>
 
<p>Send a thank you note—everyone likes to be appreciated.</p>
 
<h4>Interview Don'ts</h4>
 
<p>Do not be late for your appointment.</p>
 
<p>Do not ask the interviewer to compare colleges.</p>
 
<p>Do not make excuses or blame others for any blemish on your record. Offer concise explanations that indicate a sense of personal responsibility and/or lesson learned.</p>
 
<p>Do not provide academic materials unless they are requested. Admission counselors will review your transcript at another time; they prefer to use the interview to get to know you personally.</p>
 
<p>Don't argue with your parents during the campus visit. They will have questions that might be different from yours—let them ask. An argument will only reflect poorly on you.</p>
 
<h4>The Interviewer's Questions</h4>
 
<p>College interviews usually touch on your high school record, personal interests, and college goals, so give some thought to these areas before your first interview:</p>
 
<p><strong>Your high school record and experience.</strong> Be prepared to discuss the type of student you are; your favorite subjects, most challenging courses, what you like best about school, whether your academic record is an accurate reflection of your ability, and your activities.</p>
 
<p><strong>About you.</strong> You may not like it, but the interview is about you, so be prepared to talk about yourself and your interests. Some of the discussion topics may include books you enjoy reading, people you admire or consider to be heroes, your family and friends, how others see you, your dreams and aspirations, and your views on current events.</p>
 
<p><strong>About college.</strong> Be prepared to discuss why you are interested in the college, what you are looking for in a college environment, your academic interests (don't be afraid to admit that you are undecided), and your long term goals. It is also very common for interviewers to ask what other colleges you are considering—do NOT feel obligated to answer this one, feel free to tell them you are not sure.</p>
 
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
 
<p>Most importantly, relax and be yourself. The admission decision does not depend exclusively on the interview. Interviews are generally just a friendly, informative conversation. This is your opportunity not only to establish a personal connection with the college through the interviewer, but search seriously about this college and how well it fits you. Remember, college is a match to be made not a prize to be won.</p>

<h4>The College Interview</h4>

<p><strong>Many colleges allow you to interview with an admissions representative, either on campus or in your hometown.</strong></p>

<p>Not all schools grant interviews, and you shouldn't freak out if your local admissions rep is too busy to interview you. It doesn't mean you won't be admitted!</p>

<p>If you do score an interview, take it seriously. But rest assured that it will not make or break you.  Admissions officers will consider it when evaluating your application, although they'll be much more interested in your grades, test scores and essays.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare specific questions.</strong></p>
<p>Your interviewer will expect you to ask some questions about the school and talk about why you want to go there.</p>

<p>Think about why the school appeals to you, what you want to study and what you might do after graduation (you don't need a fifty-year plan). Challenge yourself to come up with creative questions the answers to which cannot be easily found on the college's website. Bizarre or obvious questions will not impress the interviewer; thoughtful and specific inquiries will.</p>

<p><strong>Practice like a prizefighter.</strong></p>
<p>Being interviewed is a skill, and it requires practice. Sit down with one of your parents, a teacher or a friend and have him or her ask you questions. Answer them honestly and seriously. Then ask your "interviewer" how you came across.</p>

<p>The practice interview is a great way to become aware of little things you might not have known you were doing. Do you talk like a stuttering valley girl? If so, cut down on "ums" and "likes" and make sure to answer in complete sentences.</p>

<p><strong>Be yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Don't pretend to be someone you're not. Remember, the key to getting admitted (and being happy at college) is matchmaking. You want to be yourself so that the person interviewing you can discern if you would be a good fit.</p>

<p>But remember that you have many sides. Don't show up looking like you peeled yourself off the couch, brushed the crumbs off your belly and rolled on in. Showcase the side of yourself that is professional, mature and confident. Smile, use your sense of humor and remember your interviewer wants the interview to go well too! They'll feel comfortable if you are comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>Schedule wisely.</strong></p>
<p>You'll get better each time you interview. Try to arrange your schedule so that your first interviews are with the schools you care about least (or those most likely to accept you). You can even schedule interviews at schools in which you have no interest at all, just for the practice. You'll be much more comfortable with the process by the time you get to your top choice schools.</p>

<p><strong>Stop looking at the clock.</strong></p>
<p>Most interviews last approximately 30 minutes. Occasionally they'll run as long as an hour.</p>

<p>Students are sometimes told that the sign of a good interview is a long one. But most colleges schedule interviews back-to-back, so your interviewer is likely on a tight schedule. If you notice them checking the time, it's not (necessarily) because they think you're boring.</p>

<p><strong>Be thankful.</strong></p>
<p>Send a thank-you note. If there's something about the interview that was helpful to you, let your interviewer know. If you connected with your interviewer over a book, common experience, band you're both into, etc., then mention it!</p>

<p>Otherwise, simply express your continued interest in the school and thank your interviewer for taking the time to meet with you.</p>

<h4>THE IN-PERSON INTERVIEW: HOW TO GO IN PREPARED</h4>

 <p>NOTHING WILL HELP ADMISSIONS OFFICIALS get to know you better than the face-to-face interview. Your job is to make sure that’s a GOOD thing!</p>

 <p>We won’t bother telling you to stay relaxed. You’ll probably be a little nervous. But you can help alleviate some of that anxiety by preparing. That means practicing answers to some of the most common questions applicants are asked. These include things like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Why do you want to attend our school? </li>
	<li>What makes you a good fit for us?</li>
	 <li>What makes you unique?</li>
	<li>What would you say is your biggest accomplishment?</li>
	<li>What would you say is your biggest fault?</li>	
</ul>

<p> Be prepared to do some interviewing of your own. You want to let the college know that you’re interested in finding the best college for you—just like they’re interested in finding the best students for their school. A typical interview takes 30 to 60 minutes, and is usually conducted by an admissions officer, though a student or alumnus could do it. If you’re lucky enough to get a current or former student, feel free to ask some nonacademic questions to get an inside scoop. Questions like “What fraternity has the best reputation?” or “What’s the most popular class?” or “Which dorm is best?” are appropriate (unless you make it sound like you’re only looking to party!).</p>

 <p>Many schools will not require an interview at all. But if you feel like your personality can outshine a less-than-stellar GPA or SAT score, an in-person meeting could be your saving grace.</p>

 <p>According to the College Board, an interview is rarely the deciding factor in the admissions decision. With that said, an interviewer has the authority to write a letter supporting admission of the student. If you’re serious about attending the school, make sure that your eagerness comes across in the interview.</p>

 <p>Moreover, according to the 2011 State of College Admission report published by the National Association for College Admission Counseling, 23 percent of colleges consider a student’s “demonstrated interest” in attending that school of “considerable importance.” </p>

 <p>Most of the “rules” for your college interview are (hopefully) common sense. Be punctual. Dress nicely. Be honest and respond naturally. Be polite. Ask some questions to show you’re interested and have done your homework. Sit up straight and show confidence without being cocky. </p>

 <p>And since college is about stepping out on your own, don’t take your parents to the interview. They might make you more nervous and nothing says “apron strings” like Mom and Dad sitting in the lobby. Assert some independence and tell them this is something you need to do on your own. Then gather up your courage, enthusiasm and sparkling personality and go wow the interviewer!  </p>

<h4>Can You Answer These 13 College Interview Questions?</h4>

<p>When the admission director at Dickinson College was interviewing my daughter four years ago, he tossed her this zinger: What is the most creative thought you've ever had?</p>

<p>Caitlin blanked out, but she knew she needed to respond. She blurted out something like this: "I want to learn how to eat with chop sticks left handed because it will impress colleges."</p>

 <p>Was that a crazy answer? Absolutely. The interviewer, however, was apparently so interested in my daughter's enthusiastic response and her endless supply of stories that her 30-minute interview lasted more than an hour. She ultimately ended up with a Dickinson acceptance letter.</p>

<p> I think what my daughter's experience illustrates is that college admission officers don't want teenagers to fail. They like 18-year-old's or they'd be working somewhere else. One of the chief aims of admission officers is to size up what kind of kid is sitting in their office and whether they'd be a great addition to their schools.</p>

 <p>I was thinking about my daughter's interview this weekend when my son was visiting Beloit College for a scholarship interview. Ben and the other 130 or so high school seniors, who were invited to attend, were probably wondering what questions the scholarship committee members would ask.</p>

 <p>Beloit's president, the student representatives and the admission officers tried to assure the scholarship candidates that they just needed to be themselves during the interview. I believed them, but I'm not sure if the students who hailed from such states as Oregon, Vermont, Texas, Missouri and Rhode Island did. My son was one of the skeptics and he wanted some practice questions.</p>

 <p>After a Google search, I found a helpful list of interview questions from Emma Willard School in New York. Ben wasn't asked any of the questions on the list during the interview, but I did learn a lot about my son as we sat in our hotel room with the Olympics on mute, talking about such things as Ben's future aspirations and his views on the past four years in high school. It turned into one of those wonderful bonding experiences that any mom would cherish.</p>

 <p>You can get the full list of college interview questions from Emma Willard's website, but here are 13 college interview questions that I particularly liked:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What is the most important thing you've learned in high school?</li>
	<li>What do you expect to be doing ten years from now?</li>
	<li>How do you define "success?"</li>
	<li>What have you liked or disliked about your school? What would you change?</li>
	<li>How would you describe yourself to someone who did not know you?</li>
	<li>What are your strengths? Weaknesses?</li>
	<li>What has been your proudest achievement so far?</li>
	<li>If you could talk with any one living (or deceased) person, whom would it be and why?</li>
	<li>What events have been crucial in your life?</li>
	<li>What mark do you feel you've left on your school?</li>
	<li>What do you want to get out of your college experience?</li>
	<li>What about you is unique?</li>
	<li>What could you contribute to our college community?</li>	
</ol>

<h4>TIPS: CREATING A GOOD COLLEGE APPLICATION VIDEO</h4>
<p>From the MCG 2012 Junior edition </p>

 <p>FIRST THINGS FIRST: VIDEO ESSAYS ARE STILL OPTIONAL. So if you don’t like the idea of being filmed, you don’t have to do it. If you DO like the idea, you’ll have less competition than you do with your written essay. (An increasing number of schools, like Tufts University, now let students send video essays instead of written ones.)</p>

 <p>And while every school – and every admissions officer – is different, there are some general guidelines to consider when creating your video, including:</p>

 <p><strong>Focus on content, not cinematography.</strong></p>
<p>Unless you’re applying to film school, you’re not being judged on anything but what (not how!) is being filmed. So don’t splurge for a professional videographer or editor. As Andrew Flagel, dean of admissions and associate vice president of enrollment development at George Mason University, put it: “Production value of the videos is not considered.”</p>

 <p><strong>Show your enthusiasm. </strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to be screaming into a megaphone or dressed like the school mascot to demonstrate how serious you are about attending the school. But a video that lacks energy and creativity won’t hold anyone’s interest, let alone increase your chances of being accepted into the college or university.</p>

 <p><strong>Go light on the ego.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you want the video to tell something about you, but that doesn’t mean you have to be in every frame. In fact, there’s always a risk (especially if you’ve got prom king or queen good looks) that you’ll come across as vain. Experienced admissions officials can smell manipulation a mile away. Show off your talents, personality and uniqueness – not your beauty pageant sash.</p>

 <p><strong>Stick to the recommended length. </strong></p>
<p>Many colleges will limit videos to one or two minutes. Even if there’s no limit (other than what YouTube imposes), you’ll want to seriously weigh the value in sending a 10-minute piece.</p>

 <p><strong>Watch other videos.</strong></p>
<p>Some schools will post application videos online. George Mason University uses http://videos.masonmetro.com to allow students to explain why they’re a good match for the school. You’ll be able to gauge your competition’s level of creativity and possibly avoid the faux pas of submitting something that’s been done to death (like rapping or cue cards).</p>

 <p><strong>Post with private settings. </strong></p>
<p>If you decide to post your video on YouTube and send the school a link, choose strict privacy settings. You might think your video is great today, but you could spend the next 10 years wishing no one had seen it.</p>
 
<p>The college application process is already filled with pressure and competition. If creating a video just seems to increase your anxiety to an unhealthy level, don’t do it! But if the idea of using another medium feels like your big opportunity to show a college the real you, your enthusiasm is sure to shine through!</p>

 <p>If you want to view an example of an admissions video that managed to not only inform but also entertain, check out Andrew Bergamo’s short film (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ0vEINdBac">click here to view</a>) that got him into Dodge College of Film and Media Arts at Chapman University. It’s a parody exposé that “uncovers evidence” on the real Andrew Bergamo.</p>

	<img src="../images/frame_images/week11/Wk11_Fr4.jpg" alt="">		
	<p>If a college requires standardized test scores, most often it is either the SAT I or the ACT with Writing. Some schools require SAT II: Subject tests in addition to the SAT I; some schools will accept the ACT with Writing in lieu of both the SAT I and SAT II: Subject tests. If a school requires SAT II: Subject tests, they will require 2—only Georgetown University prefers 3. If you are applying to a technical program, such as Engineering, you will be required to provide a Subject Test score in science and/or math.</p>
 
	<p><strong>SAT I</strong></p>
	<p>It is recommended that students take the SAT I at least once before the end of the junior year, preferably not before January. Students have the opportunity to retake the SAT I as many times he/she wishes. It is not recommended for students to take the test more than two or three times. There are essentially seven opportunities to take the SAT in the junior and senior years: January, March, May, June, and October, November and December. Visit collegeboard.com to view test dates, registration deadlines, and to set up your personal profile/account with the College Board.</p>
 
	<p><strong>SAT II: Subject Tests</strong></p>
	<p>These hour‐long exams are based on subject matter ranging from English literature to Chinese. Students may take as many as three SAT IIs on a given test date. It is recommended that students take at least two SAT IIs in either May or June of junior year. Many students will elect to take three depending on the types of schools he/she is applying to. Note: schools that require SAT II tests 1) often do not accept Math 1 for that requirement and 2) do not require more than two SAT IIs (the exception: Georgetown).</p>
 
	<p><strong>ACT w/Writing</strong></p>
	<p>The ACT is also a standardized test accepted by colleges in lieu of the SAT I and SAT IIs. The ACT tests a student’s knowledge in the areas of: English, math, reading and science; it is a curriculum based test.</p>

	<p>The emphasis is on verbal skills and your ability to draw conclusions, see implications, and apply facts. Information about the ACT can be found at act.org. Students who opt to take the ACT with writing generally believe they have a chance at a better score than the SAT I. We tend to see very similar scores. Talk to your college counselor if you are thinking about taking this test.</p>
 
	<p><strong>Reporting Scores to Colleges</strong></p>
	<p>It is your responsibility to send your standardized test scores to the colleges to which you apply. This process is called reporting your scores and may be done via collegeboard.com or act.org, for the SAT or ACT respectively. The College Board allows students to choose which scores to send and which SAT I and SAT II scores not to send to schools; this process is called score choice. Keep in mind that it takes several weeks for schools to receive scores from the College Board and that it is acceptable for schools to receive scores after the application deadlines. However, it is in your best interest to get your scores to the schools on your list as close to the application deadlines as possible. Applications are considered incomplete without official test scores.</p>
 
	<p>Some college applications ask for AP test scores, such as the Common Application. Self‐reported scores are acceptable for applications. Once you matriculate to college and wish to gain college credit for your AP classes, you will be required to report your official AP scores. You may do this through the College Board AP office. Call 888‐308‐0013.</p>
 
	<p><strong>A Word about Test Prep</strong></p>
	<p>Many students participate in some form of standardized test prep. The best kind of test prep is the one that works with your schedule and addresses your goals. Prep can range from completing a few practice questions to a weeks‐long course through a commercial agency. If you are unsure about what kind, if any, prep to do, talk to your college counselor.</p>
 
	<p>Note: Avoid intensive test prep during the school year. School work should take priority and should not be diluted due to hours involved with a test prep course.</p>

<h4>Should International Students Take the ACT?</h4>
<p><strong>Learn more about the increasingly popular pre-college test.</strong></p>
<p>By Katy Hopkins</p>

<p>When it comes to preparing to apply to U.S. colleges, many international students take the SAT, a standardized test that gauges college readiness.</p>

<p>But the SAT is not the only option prospective college students have. Another test, the ACT, is accepted by all U.S. colleges as well.</p>

<p>The ACT surveys knowledge learned, whereas the SAT focuses in part on critical thinking and reasoning. And it's an increasingly popular test choice: For the first time last year, more graduating seniors in the United States had taken the ACT than the SAT.</p>

<p>While the number of international students choosing the ACT is rising, students from abroad still represent a much smaller portion of testers than their domestic peers, says Jon Erickson, president of ACT's education division. Despite having more than 400 testing centers worldwide, the organization hasn't traditionally focused its marketing efforts abroad, he says.</p>

<p>That's likely the reason Chinese students aren't usually aware the ACT is a U.S. college prep option, according to Sam Hwang, founder and CEO of New Pathway Education and Technology Group, a company based in Beijing that offers SAT and ACT tutoring.</p>

<p>"No one's really taking it, but only because they don't know what it is," Hwang says.</p>

<p>The two tests have different formats. The SAT has three sections—critical reading, math, and writing—while the ACT has four components: English, math, science, and reading. Each section on the ACT tests a student's learnings from high school courses; the science portion, for instance, requires knowledge of either Earth science or a physical science, as well as biology, according to the ACT's website.</p>

<p>"The structure of the ACT is conducive to international education," Erickson says. "It's tied very much to subject level [and] I think the science part is also attractive to international students. A lot of international students who are looking to U.S. colleges tend to be in STEM fields, so I think that's attractive.“</p>

<p>But the science portion also presents an additional challenge, notes Jose Toro, an American student in a Florida high school who took both the ACT and SAT. "The first time I took it, I was rushing for time—I felt so pressured," he says, adding that the SAT felt like a "more laid back" option. "Especially because there is a science portion in the ACT, you really have to analyze the science, and it takes time."</p>

<p>The format might be a good choice for students who are stronger in quantitative subjects than in English reading and writing. While two thirds of an SAT score comes from English sections (reading and writing), only half of the ACT sections are purely language-based, Hwang notes. And although a writing portion is required in the SAT, it's an optional add-on for ACT test takers.</p>

<p>Still, the ACT demands a mastery of the language, Erickson says.</p>

<p>"The whole test is in English," he notes. "Every section has some correlation with a student's ability to speak or translate English."</p>

<p>International students preparing for the ACT should study up on idioms, which have both literal and figurative meanings, recommends Carolyn Kidd, a high school student from Maryland who took both the ACT and SAT. "Since the English section is made up of a ton of idioms, be sure to know only the most common ones, as they tend to show up frequently.</p>

<p>"Other than that, know, and be sure to review, trigonometry and basic science skills, especially chemistry," she adds.</p>

<p>For help studying for either exam, both the SAT website and ACT website offer practice questions (sometimes for a fee), as well as lists of testing centers and registration requirements to guide students through their preparation.</p>

<h4>Faceoff - SAT and ACT</h4>

<p><strong>SAT and ACT answer your most pressing questions</strong></p>
<p>By Wendy Burt-Thomas</p>

<p>You probably know by now that most schools require students to take either the SAT or ACT. In view of the importance of the test results in the college admissions process, My College Guide decided to go directly to the College Board, which administers the SAT, and to ACT, Inc., the provider of the ACT test. We spoke to ACT Senior Vice President for Educational Services Jon Erickson, and Vice President of the SAT Program Kathryn Juric. We asked each of them to answer some questions to help you separate fact from fiction when it comes to preparation for these standardized tests.</p>

<p>What factors should a student consider in deciding whether to take the ACT or SAT? What information or knowledge does your test cover?
ERICKSON: The ACT measures what students have learned in school — their academic achievement. It’s not an aptitude test. ACT scores are used by many colleges to place students into appropriate first-year classes that match their current skill levels, so they have the best opportunity to succeed. The ACT includes tests in English, math, reading, and science, as well as an optional writing test. </p>

<p>JURIC: The SAT is the most widely used college admission test. It assesses the reading, writing and mathematics knowledge and skills that students are learning every day in high school classrooms and that are critical for success in college and beyond. The SAT not only tests what a student learns in high school, but also their ability to apply that knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best way to prepare for the test in high school?</strong></p>
<p>JURIC: The very best way to get ready for the SAT is to do well in school, take challenging courses, study hard and read as much as possible. One of the best ways to start practicing is by taking the PSAT/NMSQT— the qualifying test for the National Merit Scholarship Competition — which measures the same skills as the SAT and also features the same format, directions and question types. On average, students who take the PSAT/NMSQT earn higher scores on the SAT than those who do not.</p>

<p>ERICKSON: The best way to prepare for the ACT is to take the rigorous classes offered by your school. Because the ACT tests the knowledge and skills students learn in school, it is very similar to the types of tests students are used to taking in their classes.</p>

<p><strong>Can students elect to send test results from certain test dates to colleges or must all scores be sent?</strong></p>
<p>ERICKSON: Students may select the results from a specific test date or dates they wish to send to specific colleges. Students can have their ACT scores sent to other colleges and scholarship agencies after they test, in addition to the ones they selected during test registration.</p>

<p>JURIC: Last year, the College Board introduced SAT Score Choice™, a free service that gives students the option of submitting all of their scores or submitting scores from a particular test date.</p>

<p><strong>Where can a student get practice test questions and/or questions from previous tests?</strong></p>

<p>JURIC: In order to help students get familiar with the test, the College Board uses official SAT test content to create numerous free and affordable practice materials that are available at <a href="http://sat.collegeboard.com/practice">http://sat.collegeboard.com/practice</a>. These online practice tools include a full-length practice test, The Official SAT Question of the Day™, practice questions with answer explanations, The Official SAT Study Guide™: Second Edition (also available at bookstores nationwide), and The Official SAT Online Course™. We cannot emphasize enough that there are no tricks or shortcuts to doing well on the SAT.</p>

<p>ERICKSON: ACT offers free practice test questions, a free question of the day, free test tips, free descriptions, and a free "Preparing for the ACT" booklet online at www.actstudent.org/testprep. For a fee, we also offer ACT Online Prep® and The Real ACT Prep Guide. Both are available at www.actstudent.org/testprep.</p>

<p><strong>When do you suggest students take the test?</strong></p>
<p>ERICKSON: ACT recommends taking the test during the junior year of high school because students will: 1) probably have completed the coursework corresponding to the test material; 2) have their test scores and other information in time to help plan their senior year. (For example, students may decide to take an additional class in an area in which their test score was low.); 3) have information about themselves and the institutions they’re considering prior to campus visits; and 4) have the opportunity to retest. In addition, colleges will know of students’ interests and will have scores in time to contact them during the summer before their senior year, when many are sending information about admissions, course placement, scholarships and special programs.</p>

<p>JURIC: For most students, the College Board recommends taking the SAT once during the spring semester of their junior year and again during the fall semester of their senior year.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any specific test-taking tips, such as whether it’s better to guess or not?</strong></p>
<p>JURIC: While there are no tricks to taking the test, the College Board does provide numerous resources, including test-taking approaches, on our website (<a href="http://sat.collegeboard.com">http://sat.collegeboard.com</a>). Some of the tips students will find include:</p>
<p>For the reading section, you may want to work on sentence completion questions first. They tend to take less time to answer than the passage-based reading questions. All questions are worth the same number of points, regardless of the type or level of difficulty.</p>
<p>The level of difficulty of sentence completion questions increases as you answer them in order.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of an answer, ... do not guess unless you can narrow the choices down. If you ... cannot eliminate any choices, skip the question. </p>
<p>You do not need to memorize math formulas. Commonly used formulas are provided in the test book at the beginning of each math section. It is up to you to decide which formula is appropriate.</p>

<p>ERICKSON: Students who take the ACT are not penalized for wrong answers. Therefore, if a student does not know the answer to a question, it is best to make an educated guess.</p>

<p><strong>Do your recommend taking the test more than once? What is the average improvement of students who take the test more than once?</strong></p>
<p>ERICKSON: Many students take the test twice, once as a junior and again as a senior. ACT research shows that of the students who took the ACT more than once:</p>
<p>55% increased their composite score on the retest; </p>
<p>22% had no change in their composite score on the retest; and 
23% decreased their composite score on the retest. </p>

<p>JURIC: The vast majority of students take the SAT ... more than once, ... [but] the College Board does not recommend that students take the SAT more than [twice]. Most students who take the test a second time improve their scores, but there is no evidence to support the idea that taking the SAT more than twice results in significant score gains.</p>

<h4>Keys to ACT/SAT Preparation</h4>

<p>From the MCG 2009 edition <em>By Kate Bennett</em></p> 

<p>So, you already have a few ideas for your application essay. Your grades are good, and you even know which teachers you're going to ask to write your recommendations. The only thing you're not so sure about? The ACT/SAT tests.</p>

<p>Don't worry -- you're not alone! Unlike your performance in the classroom, which you've been practicing since kindergarten, the ACT and SAT are a whole new ballgame -- not just for you, but for all of your peers -- complete with new rules and ways to prepare.
But that doesn't mean you can't master them. Before you let testing anxiety get the best of you, read on to learn more about those three-letter words that could potentially make or break your admission application.</p>

<p><strong>A Weighty Matter</strong></p>
<p>Despite what you might think of them, standardized tests are important. Though more schools are making the tests optional, the majority of four-year colleges and universities in the United States require applicants to take either the SAT or ACT. Admission committees place a lot of weight on test scores. In fact, test scores and GPA combined are the biggest factors taken into account by most admission offices. Many times, an applicant will be accepted or denied based on these factors alone. However, many doesn't mean all, and very often other factors such as activities, essays and recommendations can push a decision one way or the other.</p> 

<p><strong> Which Test Should I Take?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that all four-year schools accept either the ACT or SAT. So ultimately, the key is to decide which test you'll perform better on. According to Scott Johns, product manager at Peterson's, "Neither the SAT nor ACT is inherently easier or better, but by getting to know each, you can decide which fits your skill-set and test-taking style."</p>

<p>"I don't advise taking both tests," says John Katzman, chairman and CEO at The Princeton Review. "Take a practice test for each and see for yourself which one you perform better on. The ACT is a three-hour exam that encompasses a wide range of classroom-based information. There are four sections to the test: English, math, reading and science, plus a 30-minute writing portion that many colleges require. Unlike the SAT, anything you have learned in school up to grade 12 is fair game for a test question. Each section of the test is scored and then averaged for a composite score ranging from 1 to 36.</p>

<p><strong>English + Math + Reading + Science = ACT</strong></p>
<p>"Every day a student goes to school, participates in class and does [his or her] homework, [he or she] is preparing for the ACT, because it is based on what students learn in high school," says Jon Erickson, vice president of educational services at ACT. "The harder a student works and the more challenging classes that [he or she] takes, the better prepared [he or she] will be."</p>

<p>When taking the ACT, Erickson offers the following advice: "Read [the] instructions and questions carefully; pace yourself; answer easy questions first; make educated guesses on difficult questions because there is no penalty for guessing; [and] review your work."</p>

<p>The SAT is a three-hour-and-45-minute exam composed of critical reading, math and writing sections. Each section is scored on a 200- to 800-point scale, with 2400 being the highest possible score. Test-taking strategy is more important for the SAT than the ACT. For example, while the ACT doesn't penalize you for wrong answers, the SAT does (at least for multiple-choice questions). So, on the SAT, if you really don't know the answer, it's probably better to leave a question blank than to guess. Still, if you can rule out one or more answers for multiple-choice questions, you have a better chance of guessing correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Critical Reading + Math + Writing = SAT</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb? Answer the easy questions first, and mark questions in your booklet that you want to go back to later if you have time.</p>

<p>While ACT score reports have never been cumulative -- colleges will only see the scores you send to them -- only recently has the College Board adopted this policy for the SAT. Beginning with the March 2009 test, students who take the SAT multiple times will now be able to decide how many and which scores colleges will see. Because many, if not most, seniors will have applied to and heard back from colleges by March 2009, the new rule will mainly benefit 2010 and later graduates.
As you weigh your testing options, ask yourself if you'd do better on an "aptitude" test (SAT) or a test that covers your knowledge or achievement of special subject matters (ACT).</p>

<p><strong>When Should I Take the ACT/SAT? How Many Times Should I Take It?</strong></p>

<p>If the PSAT is offered at your school in the fall of your junior year, be sure to take it, advises Kristen Campbell, national director of college test programs at Kaplan Test Prep. It's probably wise to start preparing for either test in the fall of your junior year, though Mark Greenstein, the owner of Ivy Bound Test Prep, encourages student to start even earlier, in the summer.</p>

<p>"Take the test in the winter or spring of your junior year," Campbell says. "That way you have the opportunity to take it again in the fall of your senior year if you need to."</p>

<p>You should take the SAT or ACT again if you think you can improve your score significantly (for example, at least 50 points per section for the SAT). Most students do improve, assuming they study again.
"No college holds a second or third SAT against you," Greenstein says.
However, if you score high enough the first time to comfortably get into the school(s) you're most interested in, it might not pay to put the time and effort into retaking the test.</p>

<p><strong>Prep Like a Pro</strong></p>
<p>You'll have to develop your own style and method of preparing for the SAT or ACT. While some students may respond better to a review or prep course, others may prefer to study on their own, with study guides and books; still others may need private tutoring, though that can be expensive. Greenstein of Ivy Bound offers this simple advice for sophomores: "During the summer, read! Too few kids read for pleasure, and it hurts when it comes time to take the verbal section of the SAT." Reading more will also help you on the English portion of the ACT.
No matter your style, ACT or SAT preparation should involve taking as many practice exams as you can, until you feel confident enough to sit for the real thing.</p>

<p>The best practice exams are actual old tests. Only a few books contain questions from genuine tests, though, so be sure you're getting the real thing. Old SATs are only published by the College Board, and old ACTs are only published by Harcourt Brace and the ACT. Some students also take SAT/ACT prep courses, which are offered in most high schools and through test preparation companies. These courses usually consist of six to eight weeks of group classes or private tutoring sessions.</p>

<p>According to Emily Clough, a private SAT tutor, short-term preparation and long-term preparation yield very different results. While preparing for even a few weeks can be helpful, she says, only long-term preparation will create real improvement in performance. "The good news is that starting early doesn't necessarily mean putting much more total time into the process," Clough says. "Spreading the same number of studying hours over a few months is more effective than packing those hours into a few weeks."</p>

<p>If you suffer from testing anxiety, taking a practice test -- in a timed, realistic environment -- will help give you the confidence you need to alleviate your worries and doubts.</p>

<p>Brian O'Reilly, executive director of SAT program relations for the College Board, recommends that students take a proactive approach to test preparation early on by taking a rigorous course load. That means, for example, that if you're thinking about taking regular Algebra II, but you did really well in Algebra I, you should consider challenging yourself with Algebra II Honors instead.</p>

<p><strong>Stay Calm</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles that most students must overcome is stress. If test-prep anxiety begins to overwhelm you, try not to be too hard on yourself. When taking a practice exam, don't beat yourself up over a wrong answer -- that's why they call it practice! "Take this test seriously enough that you put time and effort into studying, but don't take it more seriously than that," Clough says. "Recognize that college admission committees are looking for much more than good test scores, so a difference of 10 points or 20 points won't singlehandedly make or break your application success."</p>

<p><strong>Be Realistic</strong></p>
<p>As you narrow down the list of schools you plan to apply to, it'll be useful to have a general idea of your score range (another reason why practice tests are so important). While researching the colleges you're interested in, find out what the average test score and GPA range of last year's accepted applicants were. These numbers indicate whether or not you have a realistic shot of getting into that school. (But remember, in a close case, your activities, essays and recommendations could make up for below-average test scores.) For some schools your score may be right on target, while for others your scores may need a little work. You don't have to hit the bull's-eye, but it's important to be in the ballpark, especially in borderline cases and for more selective schools.</p>

<p>As you prep for the Big Test, remember that it's only one factor of many in your admission packet. And on the morning of testing day, don't forget to eat a good breakfast, relax and just do your best.</p>

<h4>College Visits</h4>
 
<p>Visiting a college campus is often the most important information‐gathering tool in the search. It provides an excellent opportunity to determine a college’s fit. The junior year is a good time to begin visiting colleges—if you are ready and interested. Starting too early can cause burnout in the process.</p>

<p>There is no one perfect time to visit colleges, but it is best to do so when school absences can be kept to a minimum. In fact, the first campus visit can be a school’s website. College websites provide information that will help you prioritize the colleges you would like to visit in person. Make arrangements to visit colleges at least two weeks in advance so that you can be assured space on a tour and/or at an information session. If you are traveling during the fall of senior year or toward the end of the summer prior to senior year, consider scheduling an interview if the school offers them.</p>
 
<p><strong>When to Go:</strong></p>
<p>There are several options to consider when scheduling your college visits; let us stress that there is no wrong choice, and each option has its merit.</p>
 
<p><em>Spring Visits:</em> Spring Break can be an opportune time to visit colleges. Hopefully, your spring break does not coincide with all colleges or universities, so you will have a chance to experience most schools in action. Be aware that admissions officers are in the height of the application reading at this time of the year and are for the most part unavailable. Student led tours will be in full swing, though.</p>
 
<p><em>Summer Visits:</em> Although the campus will be sparse of students, both you and the admissions office have more time to devote to your visit. In the summer, admissions offices are generally more relaxed and willing to spend time with you. It is easier to schedule an interview with an admissions officer in the summer. Be wary though; if winter weather is a major factor in your decision process, know that the beautiful green lawns and shrubs are not a realistic taste of what life from fall to spring feels like.</p>
 
<p><em>Fall Visits:</em> Many families prefer fall campus visits senior year when college is in session and the student’s college list is close to finalized. Admissions offices may be understaffed in the fall because officers are on the road recruiting.</p>
 
<p><em>Visits after being accepted:</em> Some students visit campuses after they have received all of their admissions decisions, which can be a good strategy because in the spring many colleges offer special admitted student weekend programs. They may provide you with the opportunity to stay overnight in a residence hall, eat the school’s food, attend a class or two, and get to know some of the people who might also be attending the school as a first year student.</p>
 
<p><strong>Make the Most of Your Visit:</strong></p>
 
<p><em>Discuss your itinerary with your College Counselor.</em> S/he can help you map out your visit and suggest other schools to visit.</p>
 
<p><em>Anticipate your absence.</em> If you will miss school, notify your teachers in advance.</p>
 
<p><em>Review the college website and any information the school has sent.</em> Develop a list of questions to ask the admission officers and current students. These questions are particularly important if you have scheduled an interview. Also, read a description of the college from one of the narrative guidebooks. Based on your interests, try to arrange a meeting with a coach or professor (but don’t be discouraged if you can’t—remember they’re busy people, too). Prepare a separate list of questions for those meetings.</p>
 
<p><em>Do not visit too many colleges within a short amount of time.</em> I recommend no more than two colleges in a day, or seven‐eight on one trip. College visits require your full attention and focus.  Make your efforts worthwhile by not overscheduling yourself.</p>
 
<p><em>Arrange your schedule so that you can fit everything in</em> i.e. the information session, tour, class visit, interview (if applicable), and a meal. Most schools offer information sessions twice a day, six days a week. These sessions are typically followed by a student‐led tour of the campus. The college admissions website is likely to provide you with their information session and tour schedules and may even allow you to register for them online. If not, call the admissions office and reserve your spots in advance.</p>
 
<p><em>Observe classes.</em> Many admissions offices are happy to provide a list of classes pre‐approved for visitors. Observe class sizes, facilities and teaching styles. Ask about the accessibility of faculty. Try to visit the same type of class at each school you visit (such as psychology, freshman humanities, biology, etc.). This will provide you with a more consistent means of comparison.</p>
 
<p><em>Get good directions.</em> Check the school’s website for directions to the campus and the admissions office. Confirm the location of guest parking and possible parking fees.</p>
 
<p><em>View a freshman dorm room.</em> Ask to see a type of room you would live in your first year on campus. Learn the different options available on each campus: single‐sex, co‐ed, living-learning, substance‐free, etc.</p>
 
<p><em>Eat a meal in the central dining facility.</em> Inquire about different meal plans. Are you required to sign up for three meals a day or can you opt for fewer?</p>
 
<p><em>Talk to as many students as possible.</em> Find out from current students what campus life is really like: How much do they study in a week? What are weekends like? What are the hot issues on campus? What do they like/dislike about their school? Pick up a campus newspaper.</p>
 
<p><em>Take good notes.</em> After going through the effort (and expense) of visiting several campuses, do yourself the service of taking notes and writing down your reflections before leaving the campus. These notes may prove invaluable as the months progress. Use the College Comparison Chart as a reference of what to write down.</p>
 
<p><em>Collect business cards.</em> Record the names of each person you meet during your visits and send a thank you note or email. This is an excellent way to establish a rapport with the admissions officer who is responsible for applicants from your high school, an invaluable advocate!</p>
 
<p><em>Plan to spend some free time exploring each college and the surrounding area.</em> Keep in mind that you are choosing a home for four years, not just a school.</p>

<h4>The College Visit</h4>

<p><strong>When it comes to researching potential schools, there is nothing better than the college visit.</strong></p>

<p>If possible, visit every college that you are strongly considering. No website, guidebook or testimonial will give you a better feel for a school than you'll get by showing up. Many students change their minds after a college visit. This is obviously preferable to changing it after you enroll!</p>

<p>Get the most out of your college visit with these tips:</p>

<p><strong>Mind the calendar.</strong></p>
<p>Schedule your visit while school is in session. You won't get a realistic idea of student life in August (or if you attend during a special event like Spring Fling).</p>

<p><strong>Meet the experts.</strong></p>
<p>Talk to the current students – they may soon be your peers. If they have a problem or grievance, they will probably share it with you. If they love their school, they won't be shy about it either. Specific questions yield far more interesting (and helpful) answers.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the other experts.</strong></p>
<p>Stop by the admissions office and introduce yourself. Let them know what interests you about the school so they can direct you to the best place for further investigation. Collect contact information and send a brief, friendly email thanking them for taking the time to talk to you.</p>

<p>If there is a sign–up sheet, add your name! Colleges do keep track of which applicants have demonstrated genuine interest in the school. A visit is a great way to demonstrate your interest.</p>

<p>Some schools will let you interview with an admissions rep during your campus visit. If this opportunity is available, don't pass it up.</p>

<p><strong>Take the campus tour…</strong></p>
<p>Although it's the most obvious thing to do, the official campus tour is worth your while. (Find out if you need to register to get a spot.) It gives the school a chance to show its best face, like the spankin' new theater or their rooftop planetarium. While you're walking around, check out the flyers and bulletin boards and pick up a school newspaper to get a sense of what's going on.</p>

<p><strong>…then venture out on your own.</strong></p>
<p>The official tour will probably steer you clear of the school's less attractive features, like the shoddy dining hall or the tiny gymnasium. Take your own un-official tour by wandering around campus. If there are any facilities that are important to you, find them and have a look for yourself. Make sure your destinations include the freshmen dormitories.</p>

<p><strong>Be a student for a day (or night).</strong></p>
<p>Some schools sponsor overnight programs in which you can stay with a current student. This is a great opportunity to get a deeper sense of campus life and interact with your potential future friends and roommates.</p>

<p>Even if you don't stay over, most schools will allow you to sit in on lectures. Browse the course catalogue before you arrive, or ask the admissions office what classes are in session that day.</p>

<p><strong>Save the best for last.</strong></p>

<p>You'll get better at visiting colleges with practice. As you compare schools, you pick up on the aspects you like and the aspects you're not so fond of. You also figure out the right questions to ask, as well as the best campus spots to gauge student life. For that reason, visit your favorite schools last, so you'll be in the best position to make comparisons to the others on your list.</p>

<p><strong>Keep a record of every college visit.</strong></p>

<p>If you visit many schools, your memories of them are bound to overlap. Keep track of the details you like and the stuff that you don't like. When more questions arise (as they most definitely will) you can fire off an email for an answer rather than visiting a second time.</p>

<p><strong>Don't rush to judgment.</strong></p>

<p>Be careful not to rush to judgment if the weather's bad or the class you attended is boring. There are bound to be sunny days and more interesting classes.</p>

<p>At the same time, trust your gut. Sometimes it's love at first sight. Other times, something feels wrong (even if you can't put your finger on it).</p>

<p>College visits are important. Before you commit years of your life and thousands of dollars to a school, be sure you're choosing a place that is a good match for your personality and interests. You can't get the "feel" of a school from any guidebook, so be sure to visit the campus. Below are a few tips for getting the most out of your college visit . . .</p>

<p><strong>1. Explore on Your Own </strong></p>
<p>Of course you should take the official campus tour, but be sure to allow time to poke around on your own. The trained tour guides will show you a school's selling points. But the oldest and prettiest buildings don't give you the entire picture of a college, nor does the one dorm room that was manicured for visitors. Try to walk the extra mile and get the complete picture of the campus.</p>

<p><strong>2. Read the Bulletin Boards </strong></p>
<p>When you visit the student center, academic buildings and residence halls, take a few minutes to read the bulletin boards. They provide a quick and easy way to see what's happening on campus. The ads for lectures, clubs, recitals and plays can give you a good sense of the types of activities going on outside of the classrooms.</p>

<p><strong>3. Eat in the Dining Hall</strong></p>
<p>You can get a good feel for student life by eating in the dining hall. Try to sit with students if you can, but even if you're with your parents, you can observe the bustling activity around you. Do the students seem happy? stressed? sullen? Also, is the food good? Are there adequate healthy options? Many admissions offices will give prospective students coupons for free meals in the dining halls.</p>

<p><strong>4. Visit a Class in Your Major</strong></p>
<p>If you know what you want to study, a class visit makes a lot of sense. You'll get to observe other students in your field and see how engaged they are in classroom discussion. Try to stay after class for a few minutes and chat with the students to get their impressions of their professors and major. Be sure to call in advance to schedule a classroom visit -- most colleges don't allow visitors to drop in on class unannounced.</p>

<p><strong>5. Schedule a Conference With a Professor</strong></p>
<p>If you've decided on a possible major, arrange a conference with a professor in that field. This will give you an opportunity to see if the faculty's interests match your own. You can also ask about your major's graduation requirements, undergraduate research opportunities, and class sizes.</p>

<p><strong>6. Talk to Lots of Students</strong></p>
<p>Your campus tour guide has been trained to market the school. Try to hunt down students who aren't getting paid to woo you. These impromptu conversations can often provide you with information about college life that isn't part of the admissions script. Few university officials will tell you if their students spend all weekend drinking or studying, but a group of random students might.</p>

<p><strong>7. Sleep Over </strong></p>
<p>If it's at all possible, spend a night at the college. Most schools encourage overnight visits, and nothing will give you a better sense of student life than a night in a residence hall. Your student host can provide a wealth of information, and you're likely to chat with many other students on the hallway. You'll also get a good sense of the school's personality. What exactly are most of the students doing at 1:30 a.m.?</p>

<p><strong>8. Take Pictures and Notes </strong></p>
<p>If you're comparing several schools, be sure to document your visits. The details may seem distinct at the time of the visit, but by the third or fourth tour, schools will start to blur together in your mind. Don't write down just facts and figures. Try to record your feelings during the visit -- you want to end up at a school that feels like home. </p>
